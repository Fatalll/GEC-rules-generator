  "text": "Nowadays, public transport has become a major topic. The idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries, but this idea is rejected in developing countries, like the one I live in.\nAs a matter of fact, car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport. The possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse, the idea of wasting time in a long queue. \nNevertheless, you have another side to this reality. There are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government. There are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank. Similarly, people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses.\nTo conclude, the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it. There will be countries in which there will be no need for it, and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it.",

  "text": "People need easy, fast and cheap solutions.\nIn general, using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus. It's just near your house or your office. You don't have to go to a station by walking, carrying weights, or suffering because of the rain or the snow. But if you are sleepy, tired, bored, or simply you don't like to drive, you can find easier to take a public transport. And also more enjoyable: you can relax listening to the music and looking around, or reading newspapers and books.\nIs the car faster then public transport? It depends. The traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level. Sometimes cars are faster then buses, sometimes buses are faster. Speed trains are always faster then cars.\nSpeaking about money? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport. But, if we consider all the expenses (buying the car, paying the insurance, etc.), maybe cars are not so cheap.\nIn fact, in every aspect there are pros and cons.\nWhat about the environment and the quality of life in the cities? Public transport is absolutely better. So, even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level, public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments.",

From my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals, I can assure you that it will be of great use to you.\n\nI am not sure, however that this job will meet all your requirements. . In my case, the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July, when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival. \n\nHappily you will  get the chance to practise your English skills. In my case, I had to translate a good amount of texts, and also help English tourists to get around. Though if you are looking for additional work experience  you will probably be disappointed. All I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists.\n\nAll in all, the experience was beneficial. I made plenty of money, so I wouldn't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you. When you decide what to do, do not hesitate to let me know!\nTake care of yourself,\nFavius\n",

  "text": "The past few weeks have been really tough for Michael. This whole business started to get on his nerves. He has to deal with it, the sooner the better. For now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika, not Angelina. The one he dates is Angelina, not Malika, that's the problem. He can't dump Angy just like that, they've been friends for years. She's not bad. And he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody. So yes, the decision is made. He'll break up with her. Probably, even tomorrow.\nIt all started in such an idiotic way. The door of his room was opened, he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette. Mike can't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps, at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues, Malika's family and so on, but this is what happened. And that definitely was not the right thing to do. At the moment he didn't realise that. Only after, when Angelina left, Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake. ",

I wish to be a great engineer one day so I've decided to continue my studies at university. I'm good at school, my marks could prove it; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year. These days I started studyng English in particular because it is the most important language in the world, so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries. School is my life: I study about seven hours a day, especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more. My teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day. The big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates: they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home. The thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students. However, I don't hate them at all; they are very funny and kind people when they want. \nComing back to my dream, I would like to carry on with my studies in London, at the Imperial college. I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it's very difficult; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world.

  "text": "Puerquitour: A great experience to your mouth. \n\nNowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do, because the calories, the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff.  \nI arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school, Vicente. We discovered our fascination with food and ‘The Puerquitour’ was born. Then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began.\nThe first day started in an important date… Taco Day! Tacontento was the place we choose and we really enjoyed alambre al pastor and grilled onions, accompanied by cold beers. \nDue to Puerquitour is something to share, the second day we shared it with Diana, one of my friends from Vancouver. Again we ate tacos, but this time they were special. The name of the place is Tacos La Chule and tacos are gourmet there. It means that they have different taste of tortillas –vanilla, strawberry, chipotle, nopal, and walnut, among others- and salsas –tamarind, guava, mango, guacamole, etc. That day did not finish with the tacos, after a walk in Reforma and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Renoir while we ate crepes. \nThird day was one of my favourite, the place is soooooo nice and the decoration and even the attire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s. La Papa Guapa, which is located in La Condesa, offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks. Totally recommended!    \nMar Azul Resturant, in the north of Mexico City, was the allocation for the fourth day of Puerquitour. Seafood is delicious there, my recommendations are breaded shrimp, fish fillet and shrimp Al Pastor and coconut water.\nFifth day, it was time to eat more tacos, the place?… El asadero Hidalguense. You have to be starving to eat a molcajete by yourself, it is just too much for one person, so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did. Don’t forget to ask for a litter of beer.\nAlmost a week in the Puerquitour. The sixth day was to celebrate Magda’s final test, a friend from high school, who already presented it to get the Master Degree; and the farewell of Vicente, who is already at the USA, and that I will go to the UK. Because we like the food, we celebrated eating in Memelas Pub. You can’t go there and don’t eat memelas, that is like huarache but bigger and very delicious. The dessert? Ice cream in Tepoznieves.\nBecause Vic was almost with a foot in the USA, we spent all day together. Seventh day started with a really nice breakfast, gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea. Then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown. The plan was to dinner at Hilaria Gastrobar for all the good comments about it, but that day it was closed; so we decided to eat at El Huequito the traditional Al Pastor Special accompanied by black beer. \nThe last day of The Puerquitour was accomplished with my favourite dessert, a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything. I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love. \nDon’t forget to practise and enjoy Puerquitour!!!\n",

  "text": "These first two chapters extracted from Great Expectations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pip. This kid has been raised by his sister, a person who mistreats Pip and his own husband. Sadly, Pip has no fortune in any possible way. Moreover, he is just a regular kid with a terrible life. Beside this, Pip seems to be a shy and intelligent kid. He does not use complex words when he talks, but he uses them when he narrates. Also, his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tombstones of his parents. Obviously, nobody would like to live his life, but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and, finally, like him. At least, I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending. He looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister.\nNevertheless, the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader. Actually, the narrator is our protagonist, but telling the story as an adult. And the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words, but with actions. The narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name. \nAlso, the narrator mainly uses direct speech, but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words. This exception can be read at the end of the first chapter, where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file, and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could, and he would come to the thief at the Battery. Apart from this, he just writes exactly what the characters said. The voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view. He only knows what he sees and he thinks about it, but he does not have any omniscient power. However, his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a reflexive way too.  Also, he describes his parents in a hilarious way, imaging his father as a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair just looking at their tombstone. These twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text, accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters, when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself.\nBeside this, the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy, living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist, with the exception of Joe. The narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters, he focuses on their appearance. Actually, we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house. The narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother. And we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going and foolish, but that is all we know about them. Also, the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes. In fact, the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences, with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures. This kind of structure is widely used by the narrator, but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences. For instance, here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter:\n“My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up \"by hand.\" \nHaving at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.”\n\nOn the other hand, the dialogues are simple and shorter:\n\n\"Now lookee here,\" he said, \"the question being whether you're to be let to live. You know \nwhat a file is?\"  \n\"Yes, sir.\"  \n\"And you know what wittles is?\"  \n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMoreover, the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said. Pip uses a rich vocabulary, using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things. The marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example. Regardless, the dialogues are written exactly as they were said. The thief said “Who d’ye with?” This is written as it is said, making it more realistic.\n\nNotwithstanding, the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist. The events are narrated in a mysterious way, telling us what happened in a realistic story-line without flashback. The story is narrated as it happens. The second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief. Also, the slow rhythm is adequate. The narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters, but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text. The thief disappears, but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting.\n\nTherefore, I do not know how the story will end. Too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters. All I know is that this story will not have a happy ending. Probably, the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster. I would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts, at the graveyard. Like another brick in the wall, another tombstone in the graveyard. I would like to read a story without tale, just a regular man who died while he was learning to live. Obviously, this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing. This is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid. Consequently, reading these chapters is a pleasure, but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or, what is more, what the author is trying to transmit.

She knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it. She did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them. After her 18th birthday, Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away. After finding the adoption papers she contacted the adotpion agency. She convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of \"her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her bilogical mother would be a match for a kidney transplant\". Even though it was illegal, the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara Fielding, her biological mother. A month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number. She hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother´s rejection. After a few seconds, a woman picked up the phone. At the beginning Anna did not say anything, she could not utter any sound. But then she said \"hello, my name is Anna and I think you are my mother\". After another few seconds of silence, Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions. They agreed to meet the next day in the park. She was going to have so many answers to so many questions. Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day. ",

The walls are covered with trophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza. The space is family friendly, a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends. \n\nMy only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu, it is often difficult deciding what to order. So far I have never been disappointed. To start, you must try the Rose Wind Salad, it’s a fresh, flavourful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust. As a main dish, you can´t go wrong ordering one of their pizza´s, all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven. \n\nBesides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat, the service is friendly and efficient. The staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers. Also the prices are incredibly cheap, it´s around 12 euros per person for two different dishes, drinks and desert. \n\nI completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value. I promise you won´t be disappointed.\n",

It offers a wide variety of activities like museums, a cinema, a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from.\nThe Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended,it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music, watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place.\nThe Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays.\nThe Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students.\nSeveral people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors.\n\nOn the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them.

  "text": "It is true that people everywhere like watching sports. Sports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young’s minds. In this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided.\nFrom one point of view, top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons. Firstly, watching the success of such athletes, teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports. This means they will want to play sports, which is essential for their health. Secondly, doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons, such as discipline and dealing with success and failure. The importance of working hard to achieve goalы and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen. This is a good example for youngsters to follow.\nFrom another perspective, sometimes professional athletes are not good role models. Firstly, sport has become business. Many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame. This can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition. Secondly, there are those athletes who behave disgustingly. For example, some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost. It goes without saying, that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young.\nIn conclusion, there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people. On balance, I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth, as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports.    \n",

And since my great interest is to develop my skills in microscopy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alexis told me to try and contact you. Our conversation with Alexis and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master methodological and research skills.

Earlier I had a publication in PLoS One with description of dissimilarities in organization and regulation of adherence junctions associated with different types of actin bundles in normal and transformed epithelial cells. Thereafter I studied accumulation of various actin-binding proteins and actin isoforms within adherence junction in normal and transformed cells. On the coarse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I’m going to report on the FEBS-EMBO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of september.

This festival is dedicated to the city’s patron saint, and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore. Another important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus. It is celebrated in June. During this festivity, Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again, so you can see Roman circus, Celtic weddings, artisan markets, many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes, such as gladiators and Roman Emperors. I recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated. You can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus.\nLugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places, festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain, such as the Celtic period and the Roman period.\n",

The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country, producing daily large amounts of waste. \"City X\" has no specific waste disposal plan, but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July. Despite it, there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town. The city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council's goals. The analysis will consist of evaluating the Council's eco-friendly proposals.\nIn accord with the aforementioned, the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled, 86% of it discarded inadequately. This is due to the low effect of the \"Recycling Worms\" program over the disposal problem. \"City X\" incinerates hospital residue, in accordance with legal requirements, and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories. The recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste, and show a result 20% better than last year. The program represents 2% of the employment in the city, but it needs to expand.\nThe city has many projects such as the \"Keep it clean, keep it beauty\", whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas. Another important one is the \"Let's make it green\", responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years, consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas. A later crucial activity are the \"Green Communities\", currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area.\nA municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem. The city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish. The increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future. Most of the \"Recycling Worms\" problem is caused by this lack of training, which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities.",

Here're some tips on how to do it. First, dressing as properly as possible. Businesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion. Suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable. Second, being punctual. Interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they aren't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who's late somehow. Third, being prepared. As the old saying goes, well prepared is half done. You're expected to know something about our company, ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers. If you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front, you really stand a chance in the interview.\n  Since you've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department, the sales manager will be interviewing you. He started out his career as an accountant, but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long. Plus, he's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago. He got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department. In his eyes, what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences, so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job.\n  I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you. Looking forward to hearing from you soon. \n  \n  Lots of Love,\n  Iris ",

  "text": "If I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal: raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide. Then I would start gathering some information about the market, that is to say, social trends, population statistics such as age, gender and family type, potential customers and competitors as well. By doing so, I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers' needs. After that, I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them. For instance, if my goal was to increase young people's awareness, some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings. Instead, if my goal was to increase adult's awarenes, advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful. However, if the target markets were both, young people and adults, offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice. The last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional, experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide.Last but not least, I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded.\nAnd you? Have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example? I challenge you to think about it and try it. ",

People who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure doesn’t exist. Another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts. Exploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration, mining, production and distribution of shale gas. We cannot ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs. Even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad, there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in  gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere.

When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit.\nChoosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices. There are some travel destinations that definitely stand out, such as Santorini. Sandy beaches, crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands. Santorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight, even though exploring it can be dangerous!\nAnother place worth visiting in Greece is Athens. Believe it or not, Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The Parthenon, the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens. \nLast but not least, Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece. Other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece, people can visit the water sports parks there, which are extremely fun!\nSumming up, Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting, although choosing where to go can be hard.\n",

  "text": "The question is whether it's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough. In my personal experience, I believe that it's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life.\nIt's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam. For example, one year ago, I had my final surgery exam. I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice. The plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months. For the hard work and perfect discipline, I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals. If I hadn't had such an organized plan, I would never have got such a perfect score.\nAnother thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night. It's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching. What is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam. For example, I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam. Two days before my exam, I realized that I ran out of time. I had insomnia the night of my exam, it wasn't enough that I wasn't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously. Ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores.\nMoreover, if I aim at getting high scores, I assert that memorizing the details is important.\nIf you don't start studying before exam with an appropriate time, you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject, but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word. That will help you a lot even if you don't get the chance to revise everything before your exam. I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details. In the exam, I had that question where it required describing a concept; amazingly, I was able to do it perfectly. Since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times, I was able to remember it. It was just flooding without so much effort. So, for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam.\nIn sum, I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared. If you want to get high scores and perform greatly, you should start studying from day one if possible. Don't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at?\n",

The biggest threat is the explosion. However, the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer. Secondly, nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels. Energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production.Thirdly, only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive. When we have a plant, making energy from that is very cheap. The most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel. Besides, we need something that can work all the time. It can't stop making energy when the weather is bad, because people need a lot of electricity. If we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos, and this is unacceptable.",

  "text": "Hi Jane,\nLast time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK. I’ve done some research to find out the best savings account for you. Below you can find a few suggestions of mine.\nThe Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you. Firstly, the rate of interest is by 3.1%, which is quite good. Additionally, if you open a saving account in that bank, you will get a diary as a gift. And you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card. Unfortunately, the bank doesn't have branches in Britain. And all banking operations must be done by phone.\nThe second bank, Royal Savings Bank, has many branches in the UK (over 650), so you can make all bank operations on spot. But there is a service charge for owning a credit card (£12 per year). You do also get a gift as a new account holder, a full set of saucepans (do you really need it?).\nAll in all, I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank, since the rate of interest is higher and you don’t need to pay any annual charges. And doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English.\nThe final decision is yours.\nTake care and see you very soon,\nYours Agnieszka\n",

Every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes. My parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own. The temperature was often several degrees below zero, and you would freeze if you didn't keep moving up and down the slope. My brother showed a natural talent for the sport, but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared. \nLittle by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself.

I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field. The subjects I've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting, commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation. I've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school.

Czech universities provides high standards of education, internationally recognized degrees, modern campuses with outstanding facilities, safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity. I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe. Above all, the high quality if education will make me ready for the future.\nAnother major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance. Also, education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently, and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe! \n\n\nRight now, I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically, socially and mentally, and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra-curricular activities and community service, would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team.

  "text": "A dog is man's best friend\nIt is a well-known fact that people need to have communication with other people. However, they are not always satisfied or taken into the society.  They seek solace in  someone who they would feel more comfortable with. The best example is an animal with great qualities, a dog.\nDog's personality is one of their best qualities. Always friendly, bubbly and in a good mood, they are great to spend time with. They feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them. It makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter. Dog's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people's  face. And that is what they are there for, to make people happy.\nThese hairy four-legged animals are also very protective. One of their jobs is to watch out their human family.  So if they sense that their owner might be in danger, they immediately  react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it. The stronger the bond between the dog and their owner, the stronger the dog's reaction will be.\nIt is believed that dogs require a lot of  attention, which is not true. Dogs are really not that hard to take care of, bathing and grooming don’t need to be done every day, they just need to be fed and walked regularly.  These pets need a few walks a day, which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity. So having a dog could also remind them  to live a  healthier life.\nIn conclusion, dogs make really great pets.

  "text": "Hi John!\nIt´s great to hear from you again! I will give you some details about my experience at “Zoe Kak adventure”, one of the most well-known centres in our country. \nFirst of all, we started with a tiring assault course, which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles.  Although it made me feel exhausted, I found it extremely entertaining. Luckily, I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem, however, you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity.\nRock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face. Despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected, I managed to reach the summit. You can´t imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain, after such a big effort!.\nFurthermore, you will be able to practise canoeing. You are likely to feel scared at first, but your confidence will be built up quickly, due to the constant support of your teachers.\nOne of the last activities offered by the centre was diving. I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up, so if you don´t want to miss out this great opportunity too, trust your trainers, since they are highly qualified.\nTo sum up, I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules, so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble. For all these reasons, this centre´s really worth a visit\nWrite soon and let me know if you need to know anything else. \nWith best wishes:\nSara.\n",

There are lots of countries that do not\naccept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening.\nThe situation in Spain can be assessed as \"legal vacuum\" in light of our constitutional right to free\neducation meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education.\nEducational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning. Homeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music, sports, and even the family life. Homeschooled students' success has been backed up by the results on standardize test and the recognition of prestigious universities.\nNow though, before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks:\nthe lack of facilities or expertise, not enough socialization for your children, ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet.\nAs far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational\nsystems.However,homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .

Steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter. \nEnvironmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board. Built with recyclable or recycled materials, the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days, not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs, which is more and more popular even these days. Moreover, solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency. \nUrban housing issues (such as population growth) will be solved by exploiting some new areas. Maybe it's building castles in the air, but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted. \nAlthough people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses (and bragging about it to neighbours), they will still need a warm, cosy bed and a nice cup of tea.

Clearly, this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing, we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies. In fact, we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after.\nDespite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets, many more are just as interesting and profitable. One of them is triathlon, which is my favourite sport. It consists of a mixture between three different sports, swimming, cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding. What I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere, which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center. It also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it. \nTriathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it. Therefore, it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated. You must not push yourself too far.",

But that it is not the only reason to take a year off. Most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties, but this is not true, you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work, so you can become a better person.\nOn the other hand, many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way. For example, things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job.\nIn conclusion, people should take a year off, but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time.    \n ",

Travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live, to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists.

The second time when madman heard the heartbeats, he became impatient, scared, excited and insane, in the end, he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse. At the same time, the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious.\n  Finally, I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation. The whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime, the madman’s used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady, to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done. The sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty, leaves us a strong impression that the main character was  totally insane and crazy. Shivering inside our hearts, the horror increases.",

When all was set, they started their trip to the forest.\n\nWhen they arrived there, they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds, rabbits and deer. Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when, acroos the river, they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass.\"What's that?\", Max said aloud. They ran quickly, crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was.\"It's a deer!, its leg is in a trap\", Max's friend shouted. When they saw the animal, they could see that it was suffering, so they decided to free the deer. By this decision, Max took courage to open the trap, but the deer didn't move because its leg was injured. One of Max's friend brought water from the river to give to the deer. Max cut a piece of his T-shirt to cure the animal. Afterwards, the animal was better and it walked away slowly.\n\nWhen the day finished, Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal's life.\"What an amazing day!\", Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night.",

  "text": " The question is: whether it is possible to be famous without journalists? Probably not, but they are many people in show-busines or political life, who are ready to do everything to save their private life. \n Generally, people may be famous for two reasons: because of their job or because of their scandalising private life. If you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life, it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi. \n  There is a rule, probably one of the most important in public life, that says more or less: 'It is not important what are they talking about you, it is important they are talking about you'. Most of celebrities follow this rule, as it is just what they are living for. That is why they are often able to sell information about their private life.\n Real problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity, but its friends or family. Paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people's children, that may have negative influence on their emotional development.\n  How about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals? In most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can, leading their boring life. And when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life, they just leave them alone.\n Summarizing, I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision, if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists. And I hope they understand, their duty is to save their relatives. ",

As a person who loves to eat, I consider environment, quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go.\n\nLast Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called \"Las Ficheras\". It was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them, because the good food and funny environment. I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week. \nIn my opinion, the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service. We faced continuous problems with the order such as: dishes from another table served for us by mistake, the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking (just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table).\n\nFor my luck (or not), I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at \"Las Ficheras\" before and in her opinion, as a Mexican, that restaurant was terrible. She also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service. I got curious about this place and decided to go later.\n\n\"Pistola y Corazón Taqueria\" was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food, with lower prices and a great service. They served us \"nachos\" with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes. After choosing, a bottle of fresh water was served, again, for free. We chose \"tacos\" of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious. After paying the bill, they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirming that great places still exists.",

I'm much better now. I'm settled back home and I'm up and running, even though my uncured sprained ankle has gone worst. Last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some crutches, so ever since then it's going better. Furthermore, precisely today I have started my 15-day rehabilitation sessions! So I should be back on jumping around in no time :).\n\nAs you know, Malta was a big punch right in the stomach, which for sure I didn't need! :(. The course and the organization left much to be desired; and as if that weren't enough, my scholarship (funny enough not the ones of the (only!) TWO other participants), was not sufficient to cover all the costs! :/ Anyway, CS and magic saved me right at the last second (the last night), and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart. And for that I want to THANK YOU once again.\n\nBack home, everything started fast -I should have gotten used to by now, shouldn't I??-. So I hadn't have time for much. I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine. He decided to finish the second half without my help, so that was a bit disappointing, both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations* and for the (I'm guessing, as I don't know anything as yet :/) less money earned that it will mean.\n\n*Sorry, I'm gonna (ab)use of your native language skills once again: here \"not meeting his expectations\", could be substituted by another expression. What I doubt is the difference between this bunch: be good enough, measure up, make the grade; be up to standard/the task.\n\nThere again, having a whole bunch of free hours (days! From Sunday to Tuesday) for myself that I was not counting on, proved itself to make wonders!!! I decided to get back home (I had been the whole week at my friend's place, as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer's house, where I had been going every day last week), and I started getting things done. Plus I gave a rest to my ankle, which was very much needed too!\n\nThe two-day one-night trip with my mother and sister went quite well. The place we were visiting was very beautiful, and haven't been because of the limitations for my ankle, we would have gone for a short hike.\n\nTomorrow I'll be starting my first English class, which has taken much longer than I had plan. I have sent a lot of CVs, and have gone to 3 interviews so far, also for English classes (one company and two academies).\n\nAbout the pictures from Ramla, could you wait a bit more time? I haven't find time to download the pictures (from ALL THE THINGS that I need to sort out, I was (and is) definitely NOT a priority. Do remind me again, thou, if you see that I'm forgetting, okay? (Please!).\n\nDid you ask Mario about the speakers? Because chatting is way faster than writing ;).\n\nI'm gonna go now. Talk to you soon, Mike.\n\nReceive a big hug from (YES, FINALLY!!) warm Spain.",

  "text": "Global warming and its consequences in 2015\nThe Guardian’s article “World’s climate about to enter ‘uncharted territory’ as it passes 1C of warming”, published on the 9th November 2015, describes the problems of global warming. Referring to scientists at the British Met Office, 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1C warming will be broken - caused by global warming – which will lead to unknown consequences on the future.\nThe World Meteorological Organization made known publicly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels. These problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks. Then, world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Niño climate phenomenon. \nStephen Belcher, director of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre, claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change, Amber Rudd, who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays’ politics due to its consequences on economy, global security and the fight against poverty. She stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role-model for other countries.\nFurthermore, climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming, clarifying this statement with the example of Central England, which has warmed 20% more than the global average. Global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding, heatwaves, water stress and loss of harvests. Facing these consequences, a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher. \nDespite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008, there is only a small chance of 5-10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd, University of Leeds, as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies.\nAlthough the NASA study shows a different result, the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions, environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris.\n",

  "text": "The importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries. Their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in, and who experiences them, they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration. To be included on the World Heritage List, properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria.\nThe World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world. It is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history.\nWorld Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy.\nThe site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located, but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations. Its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole.\nAnother advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention, and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation. Greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties. A country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites.\nThe Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they can't protect them for risks. Moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance.\nIn my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO. It's difficult, but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage.\n",

To learn more about bowling one should watch Akram, Warne and Murli. \n\nI will also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.com. It has nice articles, reviews and statistics on many players and games. Reading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep.\n\nCricket is going through rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandals.

It is a list of things that you want to do before you die. \nI think is kind of sad, that I don't know what I want to do, I don't know what makes me truly happy.\n\nAbout two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called \"The fault in our stars\". It's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer, and they have different ways to think about life and death. This movie has touched me very deeply, it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things.\n\nSo after watching this movie and my friend's question I can't help thinking about my life. Now I have the feeling that I need to live more, but I have no idea what is this \"more\". Before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness, but now I think that before this I need to do other things. \n\nIt is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new, from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want. It is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of.\n\nWell, next November I will travel to Europe, the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know.

  "text": "Peoples lives will change in the future, and I bet it's not for the better. Unlike popular understandings of History (and even presumably scientific ones, I must say), History is not an unstoppable march towards \"progress\", whatever that word means. It is a ciclical process. Rome had its hayday in the first century AD, but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past. Those later period Romans weren't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier. And who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take  for granted? No one can assure such a thing. But I don't think, unless there's another World War, people's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years. I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak, and after that there will be a decline, until a new Dark Ages. But let's pick the World War hypothesis for a second. A wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now. But there's, at this day, prospects for a new World War? I don't think so, but on the other hand what the hell do I know? The causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know, and no one, or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it. One day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed, and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another, but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war  against each other would have its roots in  much older times. As the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War, a Third, hypothetical war, could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have  happenned already. \n But let's not digress into that, that's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition.

I've already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great! \nIt would be terrific if you came with me, is it possible? Could you ask your parents' permission?\nIn this Camp parents are calm and don't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island.\nIn addition, the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety.\nThere are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment, especially outdoor sport activities!\nThere are two swimming pool, two tennis court, one football pitch, canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving, and the equipment is provided.\nThe Camp is well-known  and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks, it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off, what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th?\nI am look forward to receiving your answer!\nBest wishes.\nSimonetta",

Outside stood the most extraordinary-looking man: he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter. I was taken aback, so I called my mother, who was asleep with her boyfriends.\n\nShe came down, but she did not scream. Instead she started crying. The man as it turned out was my father, who had been missing for 15 years...\n\nI did not know that he was still alive. Mother had always told me he had died in the war. I think she did this for my own good. I was very bemused by the situation and didn't know if I liked him or not. In my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic. It was very odd to see him in my home.\n\nNow we all live together. Although the first days were difficult, now we all get on well. It is great to be a whole family again.\n",

  "text": "The Grand Place is the central square of Brussels. It is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages. These were groups of people doing the same work, such as carpenters. They helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters. Sometimes, they became very rich. Each building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation. Their architecture is unique and beautiful. Today, most of them are hosting cafés, shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists, but there is also the city museum. The square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area. It is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets, old and high buildings and, among other things, chocolate shops. Recently, several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings. Every year, when Christmas comes, there is an amazing show with music and lights on the façades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square.",

  "text": "\n\nWawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe, so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it. \nThe first Castle, called palatium, was built in 11th century, the remains of it are still visible inside the walls. During the next centuries it was expanded, and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion, which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard.\nDuring the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments, as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far-famed tapestries of Polish' kings collection. Another attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury, where Polish coronation insignia were stored, and armoury. Apart from the featured, there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections. \nWhile visiting Wawel Royal Castle one cannot omit seeing Dragon's Den - a cave under the Castle, where, according to the oldest legends, the dragon of Wawel lived.\nI recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness. It is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture. Everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours, and  for certain it will be a memorable experience.",

  "text": "I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old, which means a very  long time ago. I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way, without books and tough lessons. My teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking, singing, and doing other activities in English, in a  way  similar to how we learn our own mother language. Moreover, I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old. So I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English. Even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules, I can make myself understood in a normal conversation, and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes. \n\n\nOne year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge, thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful.  I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills. Along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers. And there I realised at least two things: the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood, It is not so easy to be precise. \n\nA magician uses a dove and a black hat, but it wouldn't be a magic show if he didn't know how to perform the trick. In the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing.\n",

  "text": "Dear group leader,\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village. I really hope that you have a nice welcome and, please, feel at home. Here, in Mallorca, there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place, without tourists, noise and crowded beaches. \nOn the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Artà. In the municipality of Artà you will find a coaster town, situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant. Sa Colònia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village. Nowadays, you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore. Here your adventure starts. In order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view. You will ride until Ca los cans, one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca. This zone is part of a protected area, a natural park. For that reason, you must go riding a bike or walking. As Machado said “se hace camino al andar”. It means that the most important is the way, the journey. Going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life. On the way to Ca los cans, you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation. There are a lot of trees called “tamarells”, native trees of the coast of Mallorca. Moreover, you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored. \nFinally, you will get to Ca los Cans. It is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels. There you can practise different sports. It is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes, sea urchins and seaweed. There you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea. \nA part from sports, you should note two different culture points. On the one hand, there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms. On the other hand, there is a prehistorical tower called “Talaiot”. The function of the Talaiots is not clear yet. Maybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high-class people.\nIt is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down. The sunset in that place is ideal and romantic (especially if you are with your partner) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana. From that seashore you can see all the Alcúdia bay, part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor. \nCa los Cans is a mixture of sea, nature and culture. I am sure that you will like it and, of course, I need to ask you a favour: Please, keep the secret.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaula.\n",

This report analyses the two main facilities: the gym and the swimming pool.\n\nThe gym.\n\nThe machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer. On the other hand, the gym is too small. Every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise.\n\nThe swimming pool.\n\nIt is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length, about 20 metres. Furthermore, it is not too deep, so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim. On the other hand, the changing rooms are too far from this facility, so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another.\n\nConclusions.\n\nThe facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger. Furthermore, you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool.\n",

  "text": "The Future of Public Transport\nWhen we imagine future, we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains. As technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars. A car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others. Travalling by car is also much more convenient. Does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end?\nIn my opinion, it is not true. Firstly, there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car. Students, children from large families, old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time. \nSecondly, cars can also turn into public transport. Science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely. Anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees. \nThirdly, people do not have an inborn driving skill, so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation. This is also true for older people, who lose the ability to drive as they age. \nIn conclusion, public transportation is not likely to disappear, at least during the nearest tens of years.\n",

Differently from the first two countries, these ones are called \"destination countries\" because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers.  \nMoreover, in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns, apart from the last country, Country D.
