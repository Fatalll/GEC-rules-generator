I like swimming because it is a sport that makes me work all my body and it is also a really complete sport. Nowadays it is really important to know how to swim because when we are in holidays we spend most of our time in the water at the swimming pool or even at the sea. I like other sports such as football and volleyball too.\nI would give the advice that this sport makes people healthy but it also help us to make new friends because while we are training we have mates in our team which we can talk to and make them our friends. Otherwise it is a sport where you do not have contact with your friends what helps not to make injuries.\nTo conclude, I think this is a really good sport to start with when we are a little child to gain experience and year after year becoming better and improving.",

If I knew about the thing before I would invite all my mates.\nIt really was amazing, I think, it was a breakthrough in my perception of music. What's more, I didn't have to pay for the ticket, because it was a volunteer work - closing the door after people that were coming out of the concert hall. The good thing about it was the fact, that the band(actually I even don't remember it's name)was playing with so much passion, that no one probably even think about leaving the place. In a word, doing nothing was the big advantage of this kind of work.  There were many things that just stunned me in one moment, when the band started to play... First of all, Balkan music turned out to be one of the most irresistible kinds I have ever heard. In my opinion music like this should be diplayed more often in the radio and other mass media. The bad thing about it is that the band is not popular, and not many people have ever heard about it. Mass media do not want to introduce this kind of music, probably because it would displace the mainstream - pop music.\nSee you soon!\n\nTake care,\nJim",

  "text": "Two movies.\nDuring the last months, we could see a huge number of new movies issued by many famous European and American majors. \nThe two I have enjoyed the most are \"The wolf of Wall Street\" and \"The Secret life of Walter Mitty\", or more simply \"Walter Mitty\". The first one is basically based on a true story of the main character, a financial broker, who is acted by the famous Hollywood actor Leonardo di Caprio and on how he become rich by breaking the rules and speculating on the stock exchange market. I would define it an action movie.\nWalter Mitty instead deals with the fantastic story of the main character, an archivist, whose life will been changed completely when the company he works for is taken over by one of its competitors. Walter Mitty is acted by an excellent Ben Stiller, now arrived at the top of his career as actor. \nFar from the noisy and reality of The Wolf of Wall Street, Walter Mitty offers to the audience a delicious portrayal of the main character's life and adventures, through which he will discover his true self and will restart a new life. \nAlthough presenting a more vivacious plot, The Wolf of Street is not able to keep the attention of the audience like Walter Mitty does. \nI must say that The secret dream of Walter Mitty is a well-constructed movie that I strongly recommend to anyone who would spend a great evening watching an entertaining movie.\n",

  "text": "It is undoubtedly true that in today's modern world people commute to work mostly by their private vehicles.It seems more convenient to them to move on their own rather than tied to a public transport.\nIt can be argued that public transport system has been loosing its popularity in many ways. People feel that they can get to their destinations on time if they drive their own car.It is true in many cases as public transport like buses,trains and trams have their own specific routes and stops.This may cause people in getting late to their particular destination. Secondly, public transport seems to be going expensive day by day which has reduced its popularity. People therefore find cars more affordable for them.\nIn modern society cars have become more cheaper to buy,which in turn has helped people to have them. Moreover,many car finance companies have made it easy for every individual to purchase the car.\nIn conclusion,i would say that due to recent advancements in society,there has been a considerable increase in the car ownership.It can therefore be predicted easily that there will be no role of public transport in the future.",

However,there are also those kinds of people that get famous for doing nothing or just being rich as it's the case of Paris Hilton. That makes me wonder who really deserves fame and who doesn't, but fame is not the same as being remembered.We can see that people get famous when they die,so,journalists are basic to create a negative or positive point of view of that person. They are just people, but not like you or me, or at least I don't have a fabulous ferrari to comfort me when I'm sad. ",

Some people said that the world could be better if it'll return to the past where the life was more simply. But this is an anachronism. It's impossible to stop the science.\n\nThe question is whether the older people are disadvantage in using technology in confidential way. One cannot ignore that it's more easy for young people to improve their knowledge than the older. It depends on the capacity of children to learn more fast than the old adults.\n\nThere are not doubts: young people use technology much more easily than old people.\nBy the way, in my opinion, if someone, for example explain well and calm the use of new technology to an old man or woman, at the end, also these people are in conditions to use it.\nNew technology consists, for instance, in smart phone, tablet, pc.\n\nThere are some old people who are interested to know how work technology, but others who are not interested at all. For these last one, it's not necessary to use technology, because they can continue to live without using it.\n\nTo conclude, if it's true that not all people use technology confidently, who is interested can be involved in using new technology even if the final results could be lower than their expectations.\n",

Regarding the actual shopping, it has more than 30 shops with a variety of things, from fashionable clothes to delicious food and even squaint books. Moreover, it is a source of entertainment starting with children to elders. In fact. it has 2 different cinemas, one with Imax option.\nAnother part of Bucharest for shopping is Unirea Shopping Centre. Called in a malicious way, there are 6 floors for jewerly, clothes, accessorises, gadgets, books etc. On the last floor is the food court, closed aired which is by far too populated and full of smoke. \nBeing in the centre of Bucharest, you can go outside, in downtown to consider visiting new cultural things while shopping in boutiques and relaxing on a terasse with a cool lemonade. Most of the time, clothes are handmade and original. In addition to that, cheap is the best word describing the costs.\nTo sum up, it would seem that Downtown is a preferable place, with better value for money. ",

In addition, another advantage is that by working all summer you can earn some money for your personal expenses.\nCons\nHowever, almost every student confessed having felt homesick despite the fact that they made a large amount of friends there. Another drawback is that unless you are really motivated, it will be difficult for you to adapt to a new city.\nConclusion\nEven if there are some disadvantages, most students agreed that this is an amazing experience not to be missed.

I have been practicing swimming pool since I was six years old, now I am twenty one. this should not let you stay without a clue of how much I care about my hobby. This is not just a sport but an extraordinary thing I do in the ordinary life, in the everyday life. When I am tired, stressed, depressed, frustrating, sick of the passing fancies or fake friends, there is just one thing that is able to make me feel better and snap out of it: this is, of course, swimming. So I let myself drop in the water of the pool , and as soon as I am completely submerged, all the problems, sadness and heaviness of life suddenly disappear, and that's the most amazing emotion i could ever try. If I had to suggest a sport to do for children, I would recommend it because whether it makes everyone be in shape, it is healthy and guarantee an upper level of wealth. I advise the parents to let the children begin swimming as soon as they can, provided they are interested in it. It is not worth saying each one  should follow their passions. I'll finish saying that even when I was young if my father had asked me if  I would have rather go to a swimming race or to a candy fair, I would have surely chosen the first one.",

Some people believe that we can’t even live without it.\nOne of the advantages of the Internet is that we can meet new people around the world and make friends without talking face to face. There are plenty of webs that can search people, meet them and chat with the same interests and commons you like. I have very good friends thanks on the Internet.\nHowever, there are a lot of malicious software around the Internet and you must be aware. You don’t have to do the silly or illegal things, because you will be exposed to this malicious software. In addition, that software is created by nasty people that creates this virus to damage other people computers.\nIn my opinion I must express the facilities given by the Internet. It’s all so easy with it and useful, for example you can order a pizza to take to your home\nTo sum up, I’m totally agree with making friends through the Internet.\n",

You should read the topic that you prefer like news, sports, novels, economics, health, fitness, food, cooking and you can choose the material that it’s easy and enjoyable to read like novels, magazines, newspaper, technical books and something like that. \n\nWhy do I recommend it? When you have finished your studies and you have gotten a job where every day you do the same activities, the brain doesn’t work hard and you might have some problems like forget words, dates, information that you had learned a few years ago because your memory won’t work in the same way. I think that your brain is like your body, they both need exercise to be active and the way to get it is reading something. \n\nI’m sure if you read or listen to audio book just 1 hour every day, you are going to feel a change quickly. I know that getting reading habits is difficult, but you start to do it, you won’t be able to get enough of them and you will read for pleasure.\n\nFinally, if you get Reading habit you’re going to organize better your ideas and you may feel more energetic, if you don’t believe me, just try it.\n",

  "text": "Dear Sir or Madame\n\nI wish to apply for the post of worker in an USA summer camp that was advertised in the newspaper this Monday. This occupation is of great interest to me as it reflects my determination in life and requires my education, skills and experience.\n\nWith majors in linguistics (to be more precise, the English and Chinese languages), I have recently garnered second higher education in psychology. This follows that on the one hand I have extensive knowledge in how to be on good terms with different people and on the other hand I have a perfect coomand of English. Two years ago I worked as an interpreter and an organizer of Waterski World Championship in Moscow. In addition, as I was determined to build my career as a teacher since my very childhood and, moreover, I definetely have a way with children of any age, after graduation I gained experience at University and local school. I have been teaching English for 5 years already and I would dare to say that this job was made for me. \n\nIn terms of my personality, I am very hardworking, enthusiastic to wide range of activities, open and friendly. My opinion is rooted in my experience so I really enjoy interacting with people, especially children, and to tell you the truth I like cooking and experience new things in general. I feel these skills would allow me to perform effectively in this posistion. My enclosed resume outlines my experience in greater detail.\n\n\nI welcome the opportunity to meet with you and look forward to hearing from you.\nSincerely, \nMary J.",

  "text": "Badminton for every Age\n\nIt's fast and it needs a lot of athletic skills. A wise man in the past said once, \"If you want to be a good badminton player you need the nerves of a climer, the strength of a shot putter, the condition of a marathon runner and the elegance and cleverness of a fencer.\" Badminton is my favourite sport art. I feel happy after every game. It's exhausing and you have to move fast to get every birdy. You have to be competitiv! You can play it in every age. I started when I was seven years old in my first class. My coatch was very nice and mostly we played in teams. I had a lot of fun at the sommer sport camps and I met a lot of friends. With the badminton club in our city we traveled to different city's and countries. If you want to start playing badminton you should look for a badminton club near by and should sign up for a training class. If you don't know what racket you should buy, you will get all information at the club. Mostly the Badminton Clubs sell all kinds of Badminton equipment for beginners and professionals. Don't be lazy! When you start playing you should practice minium twice a week, better three times a week. Envide your friends from school or work. Practice together with people in your age is a lot of fun und you will get better soon. I play usually three times a week and I had a tournament last weekend. It was very exciting, because there were many people from all over the region. I lost a few games, but that's okay. Every lost game gives me more motivation to practice harder and every won games makes me proude and smile for all the hard work that I have done in the last few mounth. In our Badminton Club we have a lot of members over the age of sixty years old. I hope I can still play when I get to that age. The sport keeps you healthy and fit. ",

This building is situated in Barcelona, although it's only a short walk from the magnificent Gaudi's artwork it isn't as famous as them. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, the country was completely destroyed and people had nothing to eat. Particularly in Barcelona, the trouble was that they could fish on the sea but there wasn't an aproppiate place to keep it so they couldn't eat one or two days later.\n\nThat situation must have been terrible for the population but fortunately, there is always a possible solution. A group of fishers began to walk around the city looking for a good place where they would have brought their fish. Finally, they found an old destroyed palace and they decided to build there their own \"fish's shopping centre\". Neighbours helped them to make the building and after a few months, they began to use it. \n\nThis is a great example of how Spanish population could go on with their lives working together without government's help.\n\nNowadays, the building has been become a luxury mall with the most expensive brand clothes. However, the structure has been kept in order to visitors can enjoy this popular architecture's jewel. ",

As always after having fish for dinner he had a strange dream. He was dreaming it was his time to go fishing; he went so far that he saw a kind of battle between sharks and whales. He looked down and noticed that there was a city of marine life and the battle wasn't really a battle it was a revolution, were the fish where the citizens. Which meant some of fish were damaged thanks to the revolution, which also meant that while they were reproducing, the genes of the baby were changed. And the new fish will not be the same conventional fish, they will taste different or simply change its form. If there were a revolution in the city, obviously the fish would try to escape. The fish where going to the beach were, the people fished. That was his entire dream, he was now scared to know if that was real or not. But it was too illogical to be true; the good thing was that he wasn't the one that would go and fish, which will be the leader. After a few days of waking and only eating fish, they continued having the same allergic reaction to the fish thanks to their nutrition. \nThe homeless man had another dream where there was a pest around the forest that was contaminating all types of food. They will notice quickly because fish will smell worse than it already did. When he woke up from his dream kind of having a skeptic attitude, but he was diminishing it. After walking for a lot of days, the 'survivors' were worried, and thinking of how much they would still need to walk to find a city, also they were thinking that maybe they were going forward one day and backwards the next day. Which meant they were in the same place, and that was the reason why they would always watch the sea...\n",

You start live on your own, make your own decisios and plan your future. It has many advantages and disadvantages as well.\n\nOn the one hand, there are a large amount of teenagers who have no idea for their future. They don't know which university and field of studying choose. During a gap year you have the chance to consider all the issues connected with your future. You have enough time to try to use your capabilities and at the same time discover your own calling. Besides, there are a great number of people who graduated school but don't have enough money to continue their education. The year off gives the apportunities to get a job. In the beginning it would be a simply and without high wages job but you would get some experience. What's more, you can use this time to travel and relax. You can get to know other countires and new individuals. \n\nOn the other hand, I can see also negative aspects of taking a year off. You start your study later comparatively with your friends. It would be more difficult to start your own life by oneself. It is also a point that when you don't execute what you wanted to during a gap year, you are in the same place when you were graduating school.\n\nTo sum up, I think that taking a year off is an important decision you should give it a thought before you finally decide.",

  "text": " I have been playing tennis since I was 5! I think it's a great way to relax and also to do physical exercise. You can play tennis either in a closed space or outdoor, so you can also play it if it is raining outside. I don't like doing a sport in a closed space, such as gyms, in fact, I always do whatever I can to play tennis outdoor though it's not a beautiful day. As I said before, I sometimes play tennis in order to relax. Each time I have a written test at school, I play it the day before. I find it helps me a lot because it takes my mind off.\nIf you want to play this sport, I have to make a really big effort and try to train as much as possible. I reckon it's a quite expensive sport, but if your parents give you a pocket-money, you will not have any problems. So, definitely, if you want to try this beautiful experience, I sincerely recommend it to you.\n",

Watching history channel gives us great information  about the history of earth. Watching national geographical or discovery channels takes us into a world of animals where we get to see numerous wild animals and their characteristics which are really interesting. Daily watching news on television enlightens us on what's happening around the world. Being aware of current affairs are important in our life. \n               There are also many disadvantages of television. There are plenty of entertainment programs which just consume our time with no other benefits. It's really depressing to see kids being engrossed in soap operas or some useless reality shows or cartoons.\n          Entertainments are a must,everyone should take time off from their busy or hectic schedule. But it should be in a moderate level. If everyone uses television wisely, it can do more good than bad.",

I’ll give you information about two ways of getting to my place without significant expenses. The first one is to catch an express bus from the airport to the metro station “Yuzhnaya” and  then to change a bus for another  one going to my town where I can meet you at the bus station. The second way is more convenient and comfortable. I might pick you up from the airport by car. That would be splendid and fun for both of us because we could have a good long talk and pop into a café for a snack.\nAs for the weather, it’s quite nice at the moment but I suggest taking something warm just in case as the weather is very changeable here.\nCan’t wait to see you!\n\nLots of love,\nSvetlana\n",

  "text": "Cyberschool have been attempting to present their new project called cyberschool. Cyberschool is when students receive \nlessons to their computers by their teachers. This new way of teaching pupils has received a mix response.\n\nFirstly, being at schools with lots of other children in a class develops your social skills, but learning at home, makes you lose contact with others. When you do the lessons, you have nobody to chat to it about.\n\nAlso, staying regularly on the computer is a way to get glasses. Electronics are bad for our eye. Some individuals might even become computer addicts due to the time they spend on their PC. Let's see.... 6 and a quarter hours of school plus an extra 30 minutes for homework.....that is 6 and three quarters hours on the computer. That is more than a quarter of the time in a day! It'll be even more if the student plays games or does something else on the PC.\n\nPenultimate, there has been a sudden rise in obesity because of this new project. Travelling to school at least includes 1 meter of walking ,nevertheless staying at home doing work on your PC makes you less active and health. Schools provide you with healthy food despite the fact we'll just eat anything we want at home. \n\nFinally, I personally disagree with cyberschol. It's unhealthy and dangerous. Cyberschol aren't interested in health and safety issues!\n",

  "text": "The condition of the public transport is getting worse day by day. There are only limited numbers of government buses on the road and their frequency are not good so they get overcrowded. People board these buses out of compulsion  as they have to reach office on time. On the other hand, metro service is a good medium of transportation, it goes over the road so you don't get traffic. The waiting time is minimum, you get a train in every 3 to 5 minutes. The fare of the metro train is almost equal to the other transport means. The only flaw of metro service is its unavailability in remote areas. After a few kilometer, you will find a bus stop but Metro stations are built only in major areas. So even if you travel through metro, you have to take a bus or auto to reach your destination unless it is located near a metro station.\n\nPeople who are rich prefer to travel by their own cars as they can take any route and drive as per their convenience. In public transport many people don't get a seat and have to stand throughout the journey, it is very exhausting especially in a long journey. While in a private vehicle you can sit comfortably and enjoy your journey. If we take out the cost factor, there is not a single reason for anyone to travel through public transport.\n\nMany crimes such as pickpocketing, eve teasing, violence, etc  take place in public transport. It has been an easy target of terrorists to plant bombs, so if you are traveling through a bus, you accept the risk. Everyone cannot afford a car so public transport would be there but in future as well but  fewer people will use it.",

  "text": "Recent graduate vs. experienced worker \n\n\nOur company is a small and based company which works within the same field for almost 50 years. One of our seniors workers will retire in a month and therefore As I'm in charge of the Human Resources department has to start the search of a new employee.\n\nHiring a new employee is not an easy job. It is a commonly held view that an experienced worker will facilitate the search of. However , I would like to review another options such hiring a recent graduate from a renowned university .\n\nAny experienced worker would bring a sense of calm, steadiness, wisdom, commitment and experience of course. He will contribute with his life experience, and he will request for better working conditions as salary, family times, and health insurance. However, a recent graduate will be avid to accumulate knowledge and fearless of trying a different approach . In my opinion, recent graduates are ambitious, without prejudices and most of them are not family people as of yet. Their lifes are focused on their careers .\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that a recent graduate would be a great asset for our company as they accomplished our targets.\n\n\n\n ",

  "text": "Nowadays, many young people use more and more social networks to speak to each other. However, it can have a bad effect on their lives. What disadvantages does it have?\n\nFirstly, it is true that they have similar relationships that we could have many years ago. The only difference is that they use different resources to keep in touch, such as emails and messages, instead of writing letters, which took much time to arrive. In fact, it ccan help them to speak with their friends more easily.\n\nThere is a strong argument for believing these resources can prejudice their writing skills. While it is true that social networks help shy people to make new friends, it is also true that young people write their messages with abbreviations. After doing this regularly, they tend to have problems at school because they start to write incorrectly.\n\nThere is another problem relates to safety. Generally, young people don't have any problem in posting their personal photos on the Internet. They also publish their conversations on the internet. But when do this, they expose a lot of details about themselves, details that everyone can see, especially strange people.\n\nIn conclusion, I think that social networks can constitute a big problem, especially for people who are not aware of what dangerous there are on the internet.

  "text": "It is argued that whether the government or teachers have the right to determine what subjects should be taught in schools. In my opinion, although there are some advantages if teachers were responsible for this task, I believe that the government is more suitable to lead this mission.\nThere are two main advantages of teachers deciding what subjects taught in schools. Firstly, each teacher would be able to teach courses according to their own expertise, which leading to a more advanced and high-quality teaching. Secondly, teacher can select subjects that are more useful for local culture. However, what students learned might be biased to certain aspects. And it will be difficult for examining students' ability in a national scale. Moreover, not all teachers have the ability to design a high-quality course map.\nIf the decision is made by central authorities, the most obvious advantage is that the estimation for students' grades could be standardized in the whole country. For example, a fair grade judging system is essential in an Joint College Entrance Examination. Although some drawbacks may exist when this task determined by the central authorities, a committee comprising experts in different disciplines can minimize these drawbacks.\nIn conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages for both central authorities and teachers leading this task, I prefer the government to do so.",

  "text": "  Some people say that are not future for public transport. They argue that a large number of people prefers travelling in private transport, because it is more comfortable and convenient. But it is true?\n  Travelling by car can give you a certain status quo and make you feel more independent, besides the comfort and convenience. However I believe the public transport still be very important in our society and has a huge future.\n  Firstly, travelling by bus or in other public transport,(as underground), help us to decrease the emissions of gas, which causes pollution and global warming.\n  Secondly we all know that the public transport is cheaper than the private transport.\n  And the last, (but not the least), public transport is muche safe than the private, because it transports much more people, and so, there is more cauttion.

What is really special about this little village is the Christian brotherhood, living there more than 1000 years. That probably is the reason why the local circumstances are still similar to the ones of the Middle Ages, exclusive of some infrastructural improvements that made deceases like plaque redundant. \nThe few houses themselves are set around a very old, Romanesque church, which is bordered by a traditional farmyard for growing sheep and cows. Nearby, fields with growing vegetables can be visited, which never has been altered by any modern machine but only by the power of hand and cattle. \nGnadenthal is exceptionally suitable for people who want to take some time off their hard and stressful daily life in order to find calmness and to think about themselves in a way of their character. Since there is no chance for any distractions because of the missing digital infrastructure, any guest will experience a four-day visit the same as a four-week journey in the usual western world. This enables him to get used to the traditional way of life of a monk. In addition to the farm work, living in a society of trust in each other is essential for these people.\nBy conserving this place, the opportunity to gather a great amount of psychological enrichment is conserved, too.\n",

But also I told you that if you are so good in sports you might get a grant for your studies which will get worth it so I don´t know, in my opinion I would continue with the music if you are good at cause is better for your brain but also sports can relax you and make you disconnect so if I were you I would think about it and compare which of both of them you like more or makes you feel better or relax more or just makes you laughed or have a good time.

So, I enjoy running alone or with friends, because this sport have a lot of possibilies, more than I believed when I started to run after finishing High School. At the beginning, I had a flatmate who loved cycling and running, even in a city like Madrid. Therefore, we went out at night after university classes and we preferred soft soil paths than pavement. Later, I have had more roommates, colleagues and partners even who practised this sport, which is among the most fashionable ones at this moment. Moreover, the races are masser and masser and more and more popular. But, for the beginners, I would suggest a lot of patience and persistence, and practising with company because running may be bored, tired, dangerous, even, but if you get a strong spirit and will power, you'll see how you can reduce your physical and mental weaknesses.",

It moves more people per liter of oil used and contaminates a small fraction of what it would had been if every passenger had traveled using an individual car.\nHowever, public transport lacks some advantages only found when using our own car.

Many of us hang out together during weekends and they have become a group, like me and my other three close friends, but also \"best friend\". We usually meet three times a year all together to eat a pizza in the city center. Another advantage could be teachers: they are quite strict sometimes but they make us studying harder and this is not so easy to do with teenagers. But the most important one is that if you are too bored or tired you can look out over a great sight of Turin or mountains from a class' window. But there are some disadvantages like stairs because we are at the second floor. We would like to keep fit but we have to use too many strairs to reach our classroom and that's so annoying sometimes. We share the floor with another school and it has a different timetable and the bell rings 10 minutes before and it makes me confused but I really like 4B and I wouldn't change it.\n\n\n",

  "text": " Are they the best invention? : Cars\n\n At the start of the 20th century, almost no-body had a car. Nowadays, almost everyone has a car! But is this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n Cars can be useful for several reasons. Firstly, they allow us to travel fast by road, mostly to the exact place we want to go. Furthermore, travelling by car is a very comfortable way of transport. For instance we can use cars radio to listen to some relaxing music, or listen to news while making our way to the place we want to go.\n\n As you may be concerned, cars are very useful but they also have some disadvantages. Nowadays people are depending on them too much. Cars are being used even when not necessary. In addition, cars have been increasing the world carbon emission and that causes the 'Ozone Layer' to thin down. Finally, for our car to work, we need to fill them with fuel, which is expensive.\n\n To sum up, cars have advantages but, on the other hand, they can also create problems. In my opinion, cars are one of the best and most useful inventions. Unfortunately we should be careful with the way we use them.\n",

  "text": "For almost the entire duration of “Now you see me”, I was confused. But let me tell you that I was confused in the best way, not because it was rather wacky but because happenend unexpected . There´s no question that this film by director Louis Leterrier is the most original and thought-provoking stories I have seen in recent years. In fact, the box-office hit when it was released and the film went on to gross over 350 million.\n\nThe plot revolves around an FBI squad who face ,in a game of cat and mouse, a team compounded of the best four illusionists. They are called \"The Four Horsemen\". They carried out a series of daring robberies against corrupt business leaders during their performances, sharing out the stolen money with their audiences.\n\nAs far as the storyline is concerned I have to say that the film is really fast-moving. Regarding acting, taking into account that it is a big-budget film there is not much to say. It is fairly well played by actors,such as, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman who play their role perfectly, making the film light-hearted. If I have to stand out any weakness I will say that is a bit predictable. Let me explain it. As it is a movie related to magic tricks when a sequence is played and it seems simple and easily understanable you know that, indeed, it is not.\n\nIf you don´t like films that make you think, this film is not for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for a film that is extremely gripping and can keep you guessing, it´s definitely  the right choice for you.",

  "text": "We must reduce exam stress from high school students. Exam stress leads to many bad consequences towards High School Students. These consequences vary, one example would be that students may get lower grades on their exams, or even fail them. They can also have constant mood changes and high levels of nervousness, since they may have lost many hours of sleep whilst studying for a certain exam. As a result, many High School Students may not concentrate during classes, or whilst studying since they have many things on going through their heads (since they've been studying a lot). Based on all the problems listed (and many more), we must find solutions that will help both students and professors to deal with exam stress.\nOne of the solutions I would give is to hand in study guides to the students. This will help them as a method to study or review for the exam and reduce their levels of stress. The study guide doesn't need to necessarily be a long and complex one (since those may cause them stress too); they may be just a quick review with a couple of concepts and exercises. Another simple solution I think could help is to study as well as to review content during sessions before a certain exam, to help the students study whilst still having a class. The previous are the best possible solutions I would address in order to stop once and for all the problem of stress thanks to exams, in which most of the cases, as the previous paragraph explained, leads to many more.\n",

If so, what is the criteria for giving it. Last, but not least, what is the fee? I want to find a college, which is not so expensive.  \nThanks a lot for your support!

  "text": "I respond to the article \"White House calls for ‘genuine choice’ in Hong Kong elections after petition attracts 200,000 signatures\" on SCMP.\n\nI feel sad and angry to know that 200,000 Hong Kong people support this website. They are short sighted and seems that they are brain-washed by radical democracy thoughts.\n\nPeople who signed in the website were colluding foreign powers to suppress our own country, China. I think this is traitors' action. They do not have basic loyalty to their own country. Using foreign powers to threaten China is a kind of unwise act. Hong Kongers, being a Chinese, should not inhibit our own country, with other countries. In fact, china will not be moved by this, and this will aggravate the contradiction between Hong Kong, China and the US.\n\nChina has the power and freedom to decide the way to settle the dispute. The US and other countries should not disrupt it. It is better not to interfere the internal political affairs when they do not know lots about China's politic conditions. The US is really a busybody.\n\nAs we all know, Occupying Central is illegal. The US is supporting this illegal activity indirectly. The US always keep \"rule by law\" as their catchphrase, but Occupying Central is betraying the Hong Kong law. So it is very strange for US to say \"rule by law\" when they support Occupying Central.\n\nIn Occupying the Wall Street, the US did not seems to be much more peaceful than Tiananmen Massacre. According to Wiki encyclopedia, FBI called the occupier as \"terrorist\" and decided to suppress the dispute as settling terrorist attack. So the US has no qualification to criticize China. Apart from this, the president election in the US is full of unfairness. I do not know if there is filter for president candidates, I just know that the ballots are counted in states. There are different number of residents in different states, but it uses the states to represent the residents. I do not think the election is fair enough for the US to ask for \"real democracy\" for Hong Kong.\n\nIs the US really target to get Hong Kong into a democracy area? I think not, but a democracy \"country\". After Hong Kong gets \"real democracy\", the US will drive Hong Kong to be independent. The US always target on dividing China into many small, weak countries, then it can break up a competitor of itself. And it can even occupy the broken China to get interest in it.\n\nLet us see counties that the US introduced \"democracy\" to it. Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, there were chaos for \"democracy\" everywhere, and the next, might be Hong Kong. I am afraid that Occupying Central would lead to chaos that similar to Tunisian Revolution.\n\nThe signature collection of the White House now ended. China has not take any further action. \n\nI really hope Hong Kongers that signed in the website could think again what they were doing and how harmful it is to China. And I really think the US could stop picking on China.",

  "text": "     Learning many ideas and knowing detailed facts both are considered  crucial  for  students education.  Some people think that knowing fact  is more easily and practicable. Nevertheless, others consider learning  ideas and concept is the best way to  confront many academic and real-life problems. In my view, l   completely  agree with the idea that it is important to  students to learn idea and concept than learn facts. I would like to explain my reasons.\n \n        First, learning facts  can help students to solve one kind of problems that they may face. However, ideas and concepts give people competitive edge in dealing with other similar issues. For example, once I do n’t grasp an idea that my teacher have explained  in class, but just remember facts.   When I do my homework, I find  the problem is different than the case   discussed in the class. While, I go back to my textbook and  try to realize ideas and concepts. I work out the problem easily. From this experience, I learn that I do not just remember  facts, but try my best to understand ideas and concept. thus, I can  solve many kinds of problem  simply.\n\n   Second,  learning ideas and concepts support self-education greatly. Consequently, you can reach high academic levels. It is easy to know facts from people around you. However, learning ideas and concepts need more investigation and understanding many of the academic textbooks.  .  Nowadays, there are limited time for any teacher to cover all point in  a certain subject. When, students  catch  the idea of any topic it will be easy to understand all issue related to it deeply. For instance,  when I  was in senior year in high school. I took physics class. It was massive materials on a specific issue, but I attempted my best to catch its notion that made me recognize any unmentioned points.\n\nIn sum,  absorbing ideas and facts is the most effective strategy. Not only do   student learn more in  their studying, but also they help students  understanding many facts in our life better than any other ways.       \n",

So they would help to stop a bit the problem fot the UK's recycling system.\nThis family says that they had to change their diet too, because of some of their usual food. Such us yoghorts, biscuits, etc was wrapped in plastic. So I think that from my point of view it could be difficult to follow this life style much more than a couple of months. There are a lot of products or food, which are needed in our life, and they are match with plastic.\nHowever I also think that it's important to be concient with the environmental concernts, so some ideas like this could be good to reduce the rubbish.\nTo sum up I think that it's important to know that we should recycle plastic as well as carton, glass, etc. In order to don't waste energy. So we can use the plastic in a responsible way but we have to know that we shouldn't follow this idea until the extreme because we need plastic.",

  "text": "Witness \n\nSitting here alone, six floors up on my little balcony, when I heard shots and saw boys running. The first thing I thought was that there was a CONFLICT between someone. And then, I saw something black not moving in the LANDSCAPE of the woods. I knew a body was lying there and knew it was dead. A 15-year-old boy, the papers said.A Bunch of sirens, cops and spinning lights were down there. I watched till they DRAG him away, and then everything got quiet again as it there was nobody, so I'm sure the cops will ENFORCE the guy who did this. I didn't see them till next morning. I'm looking down at those woods. A couple's coming slow on Frankstown with a girl by the hand, had to be the boy's baby sister. They pass through Mason's bar and stop exactly next to the spot the boy died. How do they know. Then they started to put and REWARD flowers were the boy died. How do these people find the spot. Could they hear my old mind working to guide them, lead them and TREND them and get up out this damn wheelchair and take them by the hand. But I was in POVERTY, so I could not go and take them. The guy who killed that boy really need to have a INCENTIVE to kill him. That was an unfair death. If there was a machine that can go REVERSE in the time, I might could save him. But, unfortunately, were not in the future.\n",

  "text": "Hello Jo\n\nCongratulations! You're very lucky because you have free time to travel and work abroad. I hope you have had a high score at the school. \n\nMy country, Spain, has a lot of beautiful cities and places to visit. If you like mountain, you could start your travel on the North, a region called Asturias. There is a well-known mountain, Lagos de Covadonga. You could spend some time walking and visiting the region. There are good meals and drinks: \"fabada\" (with beans) and \"sidra\" (it looks apple juice). Near the mountain (about 20 kilometres) you can find beaches, but I recommend the beaches on the South, Andalusia. There are many kilometres of coast and there are a lot of sites and parties to enjoy all the time. If you come here on February, you will enjoy a lot in Cadiz with the carnival. If you come on Spring, you have to visit Seville, and you will enjoy the Easter Week and the Feria week.\n\nTravelling in Spain is easy. You have many roads, motorways, so you can rent a car and travel by yourself, without table-fixed times. Despite, if you dislike driving, you can use public transport: long distance trains, buses, etc. \n\nAt the end, to look for a job, I think the best option is Madrid, which is the capital city, and there you will find a job easily. \n\nI hope you enjoy your travel and see you soon.\n\nPaco",

  "text": "Not differently of much of the world sports lovers, I'm sick about Football! Not just a really competitive game; Football is a full mix of art, creativity, dedication, hard work and team cooperation. Even if you are the best player in the whole world, you have always to play for your team - or else, be ready to be overcame by your foe!  When a very skilled player finds himself in a hostile work environment (with talented but selfish players who aren't committed to their \"team play\") he tends to lose performance and lack good results in matches.\nSometimes, the real spectacle doesn't take place in the fields, but in its surrounds! Supporters of traditional clubs can be very passionate. Usually, when facing tough opponents or decisive matches, they turn the stadium in a really large party in order to intimidate the adversaries; coloring the benches with flags and jerseys - sometimes building wondrous mosaics to express their delight. If someone asks me what is the most important thing to start practicing (or even following) this terrific sport, I'd say it's the passion in wearing your club's jersey and the respect towards your adversaries'.",

People were building new castles,palaces and churches. Yes-churches.I think religion means a lot for people- especially polish people. I want to describe a story of the Monastery of Częstochowa. Its a city in Poland strongly connected with a dramatichistory of our country. The monastery is situated on a hill.The icon, depicting the Mother of God with the Christ Child,  known as the Black Madonna of Częstochowa was imported from Russia in 1384.And since then a lot of pilgrims  has been visiting that picture.Some people probably think - there is not anything special-  usual picture. But in the  17th century there happened a miracle. Polish people had to defend Częstochowa and rescue their countryBut the polish resistance was smaller and smaller . Immediately the fighters of Sweden began to stop attacking a hill. Polish soldiers managed to repulse them. In 1656 polish king John II Casmir made Lwów Oath. He promised that the Madonna of Częstochowa will always be a polish queen. I think it is a perfect example of an important historical place in my country. I think everybody who lives in Poland must go to Częstochowa.",

  "text": "Everybody can be a good teacher for younger people. In my opinion, parents are the same and they can be great teachers for their children.Several reasons can support this idea, but I try to focus on the most important ones. First, Parents are a great source of experience which can be helpful in teaching. Secondly, they have a close relationship with their children, which results by feelings and emotions. These two reasons may be enough for every child to consider his/her parents as valuable teachers.\nAs mentioned earlier, Experience is a prerequisite for every teacher. In this respect, parents have so many things to teach to their children. They have faced with different events in their lives and every event has had many lessons for them. It doesn't matter that they have failed or gained success on those events, the important thing is the experiences they have got from those events.In this point of view, children can always ask their parents to teach them some new lessons from the large source of infinite experiences.I myself, have faced with so many cases that helped me to understand the teaching ability of my parents.Once I was 18 years old, I had to make an important decision about my university major. So I just made a quick decision based on some research on the internet and some personal favorites and priorities.I was hoping that, my decision was the right one, but it wasn't actually.I had chosen electronic but my parents told me to have some more research and consultations with the graduates of different majors including electronic.I did their recommendations and I totally changed my idea. There were some aspects that I was really unaware of them. So by considering different ideas and opinions, finally I chose computer engineering as my university major. Now I am graduated in this major and I am really satisfied with that. So, Parents' experiences can make them strong teachers for their children.\nParents' closeness to their children can be another reason that makes them good teachers. They are really close to their children in the terms of feelings and emotional matters. They have a strong familiarity about favorites, skills, talents and all other valuable information related to their children.Regarding this information, they can teach their children and help them to make reasonable decisions. I remember once in high school I had to make new friends and I was dubious about my situation and it was a great dilemma to choose the best ones. So I came to my parents and asked their help, they presented the best recommendations for making the decision, then I could make the best friends that I can easily go along with.I am really satisfied by my parents as my indisputable teachers. they have really saved my lives in different cases.So parents can be the best teachers regarding their emotional closeness to their children.\nAll in all, parents are a great source of experience, which can help them to be good teachers. Also they have so many close relationships with their children, which makes them a trustworthy characters as teachers. I hope a day that all the children rely on their parents as their teachers.",

It is efficient and private. Car manufactures desperately seeking new technologies to improve the features of a car. By making it more modern, powerful and economic, they have successfully attracted more customers than ever. In Canada, the vehicles per capita is 60.7% in 2001[1]. There was once an interest saying that North America are the nations on wheels. Car has brought the epic change to our lifestyle. We depend on cars so much as if they are our spare pair of foot. \n\n       As result, the rapid increasing of cars on the road brought negative consequences. Firstly, vehicle's emissions can cause detrimental effects on the environment in many ways. Such as global warming, soil and water pollution and acid rain. Secondly, vehicles contain many different fluids, including motor oil, antifreeze, gasoline, air-conditioning refrigerants, and brake, transmission, hydraulic and windshield-wiper fluids. In most cases, these fluids are toxic to humans and animals, and can pollute waterways if they leak from a vehicle or are disposed incorrectly. \n\n        In addition, traffic congestion has become another worsen problem. It spread massively in much of the world and has many negative impacts of all aspects. In 2010, a recurring massive traffic jam that happened in China caught worldwide media's attention. The traffic Jam slowed down thousands of vehicles for more than 100 kilometres and lasted for more than ten days. Many drivers were able to move their vehicles only 1 km per day, and some drivers reported being stuck in the traffic jam for five days. It is considered to be one of the longest traffic jams by some media.\n     \n        On the other hand, modern public transport has been improved progressively in the past decade. Its comfortable, efficient and economic features have been attracting more young professional. By taking a subway, you will be able to guarantee your arrival time for a class or an important meeting;  In some big cities, public transport plays a big role in a modern society. with great coverages and efficient routes, subway has become the most popular commute tool. For instance, in New York, the subway system contains 232 miles of routes. In 2013, the subway delivered over 1.71 billion rides, averaging approximately 5.5 million rides on weekdays.[2]   Shanghai Metro system are 14 metro lines and 329 stations, with an operating route length of 334 miles, with 2.5 billion rides delivered in 2013. On a normal weekday over 8 million people use the Shanghai Metro.[3]\n\n        In addition to the convenience of public transport, the fare is much cheaper compare of driving a car. Some professional companies even offer their employees free public transport pass as a benefit.\n\n          The public transport in my city is very convenient. Even though our subway system is still developing, the main line that pass through downtown, several universities and popular city spots is very popular and has been many tourist, students and professionals's prior choice for commute.  There are some park and ride stations allowed car drivers to connect with the subway, It is very convenient and encouraged more people to drive less. If I have to get to somewhere on time in rush hour, I will first consider the subway over drive a car. \n\n\n          Eco-friendly awareness has positively affected young generations.

What are the effects?\n\nObesity is one of the most important challenges of the current society due to the fact that people suffering from it has been growing alarmingly. This essay will look at the some of the key causes and effects of overweight among people.\n\nFirstly, food habits such as fast food and sedentary lifestyle are some of the main causes of surge in weight among people. For instance, there are many studies by various bodies in the US show that more and more teenagers are spending most of their time in front of TV or computer playing video games, they hardly perform any sort of physical activity and also indulge in fast food. This shows that fried or package food and complete lack of exercise are the chief reasons for increase in obesity among young people.\n\nSecondly, bullying among teenagers and rise in heart attacks are some of the main effects among people who are obese. For example, it should be noted that, recent studies by WHO has revealed that obese people are prone to bullying and there is rise in number of cases of heart attacks among young people with obesity. This example shows that people with obesity not only suffer from bullying but also from heart attacks.\n\nHaving looked at both causes and effects of overweight among people, it is recommended that people take care of eating habits by reducing the intake of fast food and also take time out to exercise to lead a health lifestyle for their own benefit.",

There are now 8 billion people living on our earth and if everyone would drive a car, the smoke would be so high, that we couldn't live here anymore. \n\nMany people use public transport every day and I think this is good for our communication, because we can talk to other people. It is also good for our environment because there is just one bus for 80 people. There would be much more exhaust if every person is driving a car. \n\nPublic transport will increase in the future, because every year there are more trainstations, and more streets. ",

  "text": "My favourite sport is swimming. I like it because it makes me feel free, independent and happy. It is an individual but also team activity. In my opinion it is one of the healthiest sport there are beacuse you can train not only your body but you can also develop your breath. I do not practice swimming in competitions but almost since I was 3 years old. I always had great coaches who trained me according to my ability so that I did not go never over my limit. I have always felt comfortable as a child with my tank mates. During these years I have changed three times around pools. At the moment I am training at the Turin Sisport near Mirafiori. Is a sport quite tiring but you can relax when the coach says it's time to take a break. If I had to give advice to someone who wants starting this sport I would tell him not to worry if he doesn't feel confident. If he was afraid of the water it is not recommended to practice this sport, or be able to break down his fear would be a great goal. All in all I would recommend to anyone to play this sport. It is a sport that purifies and regenerates you.",

However, I have a curious opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, your relatives are the people who will be always part of you. Nobody can leave a family  as there will be a bloody union. So, it would be a good choice to consider them your friends. It is more possible losing contact with a friend than with the family. \n\nOtherwise, it happens that sometimes you have an argument with a family member and you need to talk to a friend to be cheered up. If you talk to a friend, who is also a member of your family, the situation could turn out to be a little awkward.\n\nAll in all, how we can see there are many advantages and disadvantages of considering the members of your family your best friends. From my point of view, friendship is based on the honesty. What’s more, not only is your best friend the person who never lies you, but also is the person who is always by your side. If a family member was like that, it could turn into my best friend.\n",

  "text": "The housing situation for young people in my country\nIntroduction:\nThe purpose of this report is to evaluate the range of options available for many twenty-somethings in order to choose their housing system in my country, as well as the main obstacles they face with each one. Moreover, it will also describe the possible housing outlook in the next years and the consequences for young people.\nWho can afford a house?\nNowadays owning your own house has become an uphill struggle unless you were willing to pay through the nose for it. Due to the enormous economic crisis that have shaken Europe and that have intoxicated the real-estate market, most of the prices are eye-watering expensive for college students that want to study abroad or simply emancipate. Even if they manage to save the amount of money for a flat it usually has not enough room to swing a cat. In addition the unwillingness of the banks to lend money to anyone without a stable job is something important to take into account. \nIf you cannot afford it, then just rent it.\nAlthough renting is the first option for most of the youth, rents also had been affected for the housing bubble and their prices have shot up too. Then, sharing the costs could be the solution for lots of students beyond all the problems that could arise from the communal living. \nAt least you’ll always have your parents.\nIn order to save up for future plans, a large number of early adults prefer to stay under the wing of parents rather than leaping in the dark and go out. That could be end in constant arguments because of issues like intimacy and so on.\nWhat about the future?\nThe future remains uncertain until the economic situation gets over. As there are no many signs for this to become real, young people must wait to start their own lives.\n",

Most of those plans would not be possible, if there were not for means of transport. But which one, public transport or our own car we will be choosing more often in future?\nOn the one hand it is more convenient to have a car. Owning vechicle is very comfortable and gives you independence. It enable you to go everywhere you want no matter when. You can also stop caring about how much you taking to work and on trips, being able to hide all those things inside of your trunk while it is impossible in any other means of transport,\nOn the other hand, having your own car is expensive and no everyone could afford it. For those people there is always another option - public transport. It is not only cheaper, but also saves you from such problems as lack of  parking places and reduce traffic jams.

Nowadays, we have a lot of electronic devices such as microwaves, remote contols for tv, electronic devices for cooking, personal computers, and so on and so forth. Each one make the everyday life a bit more easy, but a real progress on home would be electronic devices that were connected to the mind. This would be my 'home of future'. An inner electronic system would compose the whole house; it would include small devices of wave reception connected, in every side of house, to a gum headband whose function would be to identify the neuronal stimuli and to convert them on radiowaves. This headband would be related to household chores such that if you would need to washing dishes or to sweeping, you only may to think about it and the robotized system of the house would send orders to each part of the house itself. This system would also be connected to the Internet in a 'dual output port remote of information'. \nHaving explained it, I am completely sure that this outline of my 'house of future' will astonish and marvel everyone who read my sublime project.",

  "text": "Dear Paul,\nHow are you donig? I remember you wanted me to tell you about my experience with helping at a concert I've been to last month. I am glad to tell you that it was awesome and I hope that I will be able to do something like that again. I am convinced that it was one of the best days in my life.\nIt all started when I applied for being a volunteer at this event. I didn't think that I have any chance to get there, because of the big amount of rivals. But I fortunately did it. I attached to a group of people who were responsible for informing public about the programme and all the organisation stuff. There were so many guests and I was afraid that it will be too hard for me to do it right. But my new friends from this group were very polite and we worked together, so it was much easier, than I thought at first.\nAfter some time I felt sad, because I realised that I won't be albe to see the bend playing at the stage, because I had to stay in front of the entry. But after the first song, when the audience started to sing and dance, our manager came to us and told us that we can go see the concert. I was so extremely happy. I was having a great time through the entire concert. After that we went to the backstage and spent some time with the band. We took some pohotos and got autographs. It was really cool.\nAs you can see, it was all really amazing. I met a lot of fantastic people and I am still in touch with them. I hope that next time you will be able to go with me.\nLove, XY.",

But, considering the increase in private vehicles in our crowdly populated world, it is recommended by geologists and eco-scientists that we use public transportation. By this way, we not only contribute to saving our eco-system, we also contribute to increasing the national revenue. When mobile phones have conquered our palms, we have no time to even meet our parents and children. Our interaction with human beings have pathetically reduced. Exchanging greetings, expressing emotions, updating work status, gaming, studying and more have become activities we do using mobile phones. Cars are mostly used by people travelling for long distances in shorter time. Inside cities and for shorter distances, nothing can be more comfortable and safe than public transport. Using public transport not only helps us reach our destination safely, but also gives us ample opportunities to network and be with our people. They are safer, cheaper and faster. Even if cars outnumber users, public transport will continue to help and support us in a safe and a healthy living. ",

  "text": "\nIn many countries, it's consider that the relatives are the close family and the only people with an individual can be just the way he is.\n This point of view is based on, for example, that you shares an important bond with your family or that you know everything about some members, like your cousins and they know everything about you. Maybe, most of us have spent our childhood with our cousins and they were our best friends for ages. Siblings are another strong point to support this statement. It's usual to hear that this kind of bond is the strongest inside a family, because everybody thinks that siblings are the only ones whom you could rely on, despite not always it's true. I should talk in the third person because I don't have any brothers or sisters, but a close cousins. In my case, this role is played by them.\n\nOn the other hand, we can find arguments against this statement. For example, the debate about the statement that you cannot choose your family, but your friends. Thus, it fits perfect for those people who have a bad relation with their families. They have to look for the needs provided by the family in other people with whom they can trust. \n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, it's true that is less probable to find negative feelings inside family, like envy, refuse or hate. So, if you tell a secret to your sister or your cousin, it's almost obvious that they aren't going to spread it. Even, if you look for a good advice, some members of your family could help you from the heart. But, family not always guarantees these functions neither friends. However, friends can be as a family and fulfil all this functions, too. Therefore, I only would like to remark that family not means relatives, but those people with whom you can feel as at home. That is, in any place suddenly you can find someone who could become in your most close relative. ",

  "text": "In recent years, whether using internet is beneficial or not has never failed to attract people's attention. While many people believe that internet brings a vast amount of problems such as reduction of interaction between people and some bad information resources; in contrast, I have a strong position that internet brings manyfold benefit than drawbacks.\nPeople should first recognize that searching information these days is much more convenient than in the past. We must come to library to pay a lot of time finding information we need on the shelves the earlier time. On the other hand, we can assess the information with only a click button nowadays. Clearly, the assessment become much more efficiently with computer and internet.\nYet, perhaps the strongest argument in favor of using internet is that the vast amount of information contended in it. All the information in the world can emerge immediately after a click. Admittedly, some knowledge is not accurate and logical enough, it still offers us many other useful sources. Simultaneously, some sources contended pornography and violent information which make many people afraid of using internet to search information. Nevertheless, it remains a good way to reserve and supply information which hoped to have more flows in the future.",

Don't forget to recognise the most activities and tasks for you. It's very important, because if you don't do that, so it'll never work. You have to put a time to do your tasks.

The visibility was very poor because the moon was hiding behind dark grey shadows, but Michael went on the memory. Suddenly, a thumledown cottage emerged from the darkness. Michael up two little steps and heard wail of the wind. But it wasn't the wind. Someone was singing a sad song. He felt a range and a fear of disclosure. \"Why is she singing? Is she mad? The Nazis can be everywhere,\" he thought and unlocked the door with a little key. \"Stop with the singing!\" he whispered, \"someone can hear it.\" Then he calm down and took a little packet out of his pocket and put it on the floor. There were two slices of a bread and a little apple inside the packet. He was starving more then ever since he had hidden a young Jewish woman. On the other hand, she was related to him by blood and how could he said No! when she came and bagged him for help. She said nothing and made herself invisible.

I should present  a little bit of history of it. After more than seven hundred years, in 1733, the latin-catholic bishops residence was moved from Cenad to Timisoara, where the first cathedral became the church of jesuists monks.The design of the actual Dom was realized in baroque style of Vienna. The cathedral hasa height of 55 m. The Dom was rise at rank of first church of Timisoara by the empress Maria Tereza in 1756.What is very interesting to see is a painting made by Michelangelo Uterberger showing Saint Gheorghe riding and fighting with the basilisk.The visitors programme is from Monday to Sunday, from ten o’clock a.m to six p.m. And a phone number where you can call for more information is 0040212345678.",

In 2014 I met a couple from One Direction called Larry Stylinson but they can't \"come out\" because of his managers. I admire them because no matter what their managers make them go through, they always find the way to show us how much they love each other and how much they want to be free. I really hope this \"hiatus\", this is how they called their break, they can be happy and spend time together without fake girlfriends, managers or the media around them. I want them to be happy.

  "text": "Famous people live completely in a different way than unpopular people. It is believed they are extraordinary, perfectly beautiful and incredible happy like we see their in magazines and TV. Everybody longs to be a well-known and admired person leading rich and carefree life. Unfortunately, truly it isn't so amazing like it seems to be. There are a lot of disadvantages of being a star, of witch normal people don't realised for example not having a private life. There are a lot of various viewpoints and I would like to consider them. Famous people haven't got private life. Almost every their mystery come out and they are still judged, criticised or joked. Journalilst and paparazzi constantly follow them and try to catch them in a stupid situation and enhance ath the cost of them. Everybody makes mistakes, but their mistakes are wtitten and known by the society, what is unfair and harmful. They deserve to have a normal life, have mysteries, a moment of peace without interest around them. Being all the time in a centre of attention is incredibly overwhelming. It can lead to being touchy and gloomy. That is why a lot of big name suffer from depression or even try take their life. \nOn the other side, there is a price of celebrity and they should just reconcile themselves to this. They got so lot compared with unpopular people, that's why I think it would be unfair, if they have also private life. People can not have everything and live like they want. They ought to apprecciate what they have and stop complaining aboout their life, because there is plenty of people, who dream to be them. Famous people have to consider how many humans suffer from famine or work very hard to earn their living. They have not got expensive cars, detached houses, they can't afford travelling and their only entertainment is watching TV. They should remember they are lucky devils not like they often think-victim. \nTo sum up, It is hard to simply claim, that famous people deserve have a private life and being left alone by paparazzi or not. Everyone from time to time need a moment of peace to relaxed and recover their strength. However, nobody has everything they dreamed; it is normal, that always in our lives something would be annoy us. Famous people have to notice, how much they have, apprecciate it and stop complaining about not having a private life, because it is not such a disaster like they often think. ",

While reasons can be given to justify the latter, I am in favour of the former.\nFirstly, travelling by train, metro or bus can lead to the reduction of gasoline consumption. As a result, they offer low fee and play an important role in the environment protection. It was reported that for one hundred kilometers running, each car was consumed ten to thirteen liters of gasoline, and released a certain proportion of air polutted. Meanwhile, with the same amount of energy, bus carried fifties of people, and even up to as high as hundreds of people with the massed transportation. \nSecondly, it could not be denied that travelling by car is convenient, however people who agreed with the idea point out that high quality and modern public transport such as Shingasen in Japan or TGV in Europe are much more comfortable. Trains or MRTs \ncan also satisfy passengers who could not travel by plane and require to take long haut jouneys. There are some places in developing countries, for example in remote or highland areas, people have not seen a car for many years, they have no choice except old buses to travel.\nIn conclusion, public transportation is still the first choice of people in the future.",

  "text": "So many people around me think that makes not any sense spending community taxes in public transport. These persons usually give arguments such as that the public transport is never in time, or that is difficult to get your destination using it and without having to take 3 different routes or even that public transport is not as suitable for a made up short notice trip as can be a car in property.\nIn my opinion these arguments depend on how efficiently designed is the public transport system, having in count number of routes, timetables, cost of the tickets and facilities for users who use it frequently. It's quite well known the benefits that a good public transport system gives to the community: an important reduction of contaminant gases, a hight decrease of acoustic contamination as well as, as consequence of having less cars circulating by our streets, an increase of pedestrian areas used by pedestrians for healthy activities such as walking, running or cycling. All these benefits surely will contribute to a better future for all the habitants so let's give a chance to the public transport.",

I am currently carrying out my Final Project as well as preparing the First Certificate Exam, planned for July and June, respectively.\nI would love to improve both my practical knowledge about renewable energies and my English level, and I firmly believe that the Erasmus internship programme could be the best option for me to achieve these targets. Thus, the aim of this letter is to explore the possibility of realizing an internship in your company.\nIn this programme, the trainee carries out different tasks supervised by a company tutor and also advised by a university tutor. The trainee receives a grant to help to cover subsistence cost, so the company is not required to pay him a salary. Furthermore, as the programme is endorsed by European Union, the trainee disposes of accident and liabiliy insurance. As for the duration, the internship can last from a minimum of 2 months up to 12 months, being 3 months the period covered by the subsistence grant.\nI will be completely available to do the internship from next September on. I can assure you that I will put all my effort into learning and making the most of my stay in your company. I hope you will consider my application, and look forward to hearing from you.\nYours faithfully,\nFabio\n\n",

  "text": "My favorite sport is running. One may ask why among all those possible activities, this one was chosen. Of course I do not count running indoors, but only outdoors, while the breeze is blowing in one's face during the exercise. That is what I call a good activity. There is not exactly a good day for running, for even the rainy days are excellent for a good run. If one has a sunny and windy weather, it is nice because the sun warms one up and the wind helps keep it fresh. On the other hand, if it is rainy, the cold water cools it down and make one feel less tired during one's time.\nThis is my favorite sport for it improves health in some many ways and boost the resistance and quality of life. The first times may be hard, in that they require a preparation a sedentary person does not have. There can be some pain and almost everybody becomes really exhausted at the beginning. After the first trials, however, improvements are shortly noticed and the results come quickly: better breathing, uninterrupted and quiet sleep, and an unmistakable sense of well-being. It even helps reducing your belly!\nDespite being a common and easy to do activity, running needs some care to prevent injuries and other disturbances as well. Efficient sweat expeller socks help one reduce the uncomfortability and keep one's feet in a nice temperature. Notwithstanding, a formidable pair of shoes makes a huge difference if one plans to keep practising the sport for a long period. Go to a doctor, ask him to analyse the type of step to make up with an ideal footwear. This way, there will be less trouble when practising the exercise.\nI must say that, as a runner, I do not regret it at any time.

  "text": "I always considered football as a piece of art. Does not matter how hard the players tried to win, the only thing that matters is the result. Players must be considered as a paintor working in a piece of art. Only results will be recognized at the end. It's not the efford they have applied or all the hopes they had. There expectations will be considered unuseful. Poeple won't stare a paint at a museum thinking how hard the artist tried to do a good job, they will judge it only. Do they like it or not. \nThe crowd in the stadium only wants their team to win. After that, if they played a good game will be a plus. Everything after a successful result will be a plus. So if someone ever is woundering start practising this sport, they should be aware that lots of people will be expecting them to win. I would recommend them always remember that, so if things don't result as they expected, they won't feel disappointed. It's all part of the game. ",

Generally speaking, there are two basic methods of employee motivation: rewards involving money and non-financial rewards.

The whole town is gorgeous and you seem to be in another age of history.\n The restaurant has a characteristic decoration indeed because you seem to be inside a train. However, the most impressive thing is the game of flavours that explode  inside your mouth . My favourite one is a golden egg made of foie.  \nThe connection between quality and price is plenty balanced.In fact, there are always plenty of people every day so I recommend ordering at least one week before going. \nI know from personal experience that it is worth tasting the gourmet sampling menu. I really think it is suitable for the class because each one of us could know in advance how would pay to eat there and besides this could taste the main courses of this restaurant.\nWithout shadow of doubt I am absolutely sure this could be the best option for our class.\n",

I have always preferred to relax during some series or soap opera, but after watching 'Flushed' I change my point of view. If you haven't seen it yet, after reading this short text you'll go to the cinema if you only have a chance. \nTHE BIRTH OF NEW STAR\nI guess that a name Ann Smith tells you nothing. And that's obvious because it's the first serious production of this young, prospective director, whose 'Flushed\" became a worldwide hit. It is said that a well-known cast enabled her to be highly granted for her piece, but I have some doubts about it.  \nTHE STRENGHT OF SPECIAL EFFECTS \nAnd that's why I find this move so excited. An enormous amount of additional attractions for viewer provided me with  unforgettable feelings. Everything came us a surprise and you didn't expect that this or that action is just taking place. The movie requires from us to be strongly concentrated on what is going on and I find it to be one of mostly conceiving factors for those who still have some objections. The director gives a choice to broaden our mind and to come up with our own conclusion or maybe imaginable ending of the gripping story.\nRECOMMENDATONS\nFor me there is no better movie to be presented in our club. Taking into consideration our interest in the field of thrillers, under no cicumstances can we miss it!\n",

  "text": "All About me \n\nHi! My name is Ester, I was born in Danderyd and \nI have not moved since that.\nI have got one sister, she is 15 years old and her name is Tina, she is also going in Fribergaskolan. I also have a little rabbit which is named Frippe, he is so cute and cuddly. But my dream is to own a horse because I love riding. On \nFridays and Saturdays I go riding at the riding center \nnamed “Djursholms ridskola”  and at Sundays I often go \nto my “carer horse”, it´s like your own horse for a day (or more) in the week and mine is Saturdays. My carer horse is named Wiggins but he´s called Viggo. Viggo is a black, quite small pony. He´s a little bit lazy but loves to run fast, so he is lazy in a smart way. I love him and I hope he loves me back.\n\nWhen I was eight years old I visited Thailand, it was wonderful and we lived at a hotel so close to the beach, I could nearly touch the sand from the pool. We rode on Asian elephants and dived in the water. One day we were out to three different Islands in a diving- group. One of the islands was a cave you had to swam into it, it was very beautiful.\nWhen we were in Thailand we saw many different animals, everything from big leguans to rainbow fishes and deadly sea-snakes.\n\nEvery year at the sport-vaccination me, my mom and my sister are going to Switzerland to go skiing in the alps, it´s wonderful and really fun. We have never seen a marmot but I so want to. We have went to Champéry a couple of times. In Champéry you can ski over to France, that is awesome. We have also went to Verbier, I loved the cabin we slept in there. It was very big but was cozy at the same time.\n\nThree words that describe me best is perhaps, animal lover, happy and a perfectionist ? It´s hard to say something like that about yourself. A weakness I would like to eliminate is that I often think or say “I do that later” and never doing it or say the same thing when it´s time to do that. That is really annoying for my mom and others.\n\nI like food, especially Italian food, It is my favorite food to eat. And of Italian food I like  pizza (thin with tuna) or  some delicious pasta the most. My favorite restaurant is “La Piazza” in Djurholm and it is of course Italian, I have actually been in Italy twice, in Rome and Florence and in a small town named Lucignano in the countryside. I think that’s my favorite country too. When we were there last summer, I saw an endangered and rare bird which is called Hoopoe. It was beautiful and had like a mohawk of orange feathers on its head.\n\nI like to read too, my favorite type of books is horse books or just  random books  its hard to explain but I mean, books with daily action not sciene-fiction or romantic. Some of the books I like is named only way is up and steal the show and is written by Emmy Abrahamson, I think she is a very well author, another author I like is John Boyne who has written the terrible thing that happened to Barnaby brocket. Right now I read a book called “the maze runner” it is very exciting.\n\nWhen I grow up I want to be a vet, it´s a dream come true for me, I hope I will go to other countries like Australia and job there as a vet for a couple of years. I have never been blood scared or something like that and I would love to have a job I think is fun lifetime out.\nAnother dream job for me would be an art-director. I love to design presentations and edit things at the computer but also in real life like my room, clip-art and more.",

  "text": "Parkour is a discipline in which its main proporse is to train your body and mind to be able to pass through a point A to point B, in any kind of environment, the safest and faster way without causing no harm to your body. Parkour was developed in  Lisses, Frace, around the 1980's. One of the faundations used to develop Parkour was the Natural Method created by Georges Hébert. Basicaly, the method is based in develop the main foundations of moviment of the human body, they are: swim, run, walk, jump, quadruped moviment, climb, lift things, balance and defend yourself.\nRaimond Belle was a former Vietnam souldier and worked as a fireman in the French army. He had a great background in gymnastics and, sice he was a teenage, he used to do a lot of exercises. The roots of Parkour was developed by him and he taught some of Parkour thechniques to the fireman which he used to work with. His son, David Belle, was taught some of the faundations of Parkour too. David and a group of friends tried to adapt this techniques to the urban environment and then the actual Parkour was born. Some people say that David criated Parkour but, in fact, his father develop all the idea of the discipline. David adapted it to the urban environment and created new moves.\nParkour isn't just a physical discipline, there is also the philosofical part. Altruism, \"be strong to be useful\" (it is actually a frase Natural Method), develop your body and mind so that in a dangerous situation you will be able to save yourself and other people and so on. Therefore, is due to its philosofy and the joy that I fell before, during and after a train, this is why Parkour is my favorite exercise.",

There are less people who use the public transport in the city because they prefer travelling by car rather than in public transport.For this reason, the use of public transport is going down, and some experts say that there is no future for the public transport.\n\nFor lot of people, travel by your own car is more comfortable than travel by public transport like bus or metro, because you do not depend on a schedule, that it is very common when you take public transport. Conversely, when you travel by your own car, you save a lot of time during the journey.\n\nHowever, public transport has also advantages. On the one hand,public transport affords you to waste money, because the price of the ticket is not very expensive. On the other, travelling by metro or bus pollute less than going by car. The reason is that when you use the car,you normally go on your own and when you travel by metro or car lot of people are travelling at the same time as you.\n\nIn my opinion, there are more people who travel by car every day, even for short journeys. For me, people have become very lazy and they prefer the car rather than puiblic transport, because you can take the car when you want and go where you want whotout spending hours waiting for the bus. The consequence of this is that in the near future the public transport will disappear. ",

For example, cars are the main kind of transport because of this most of the families have more than one in their houses. However, changes always has a negative side. According to the last studies, pollution increases this year in the biggest cities whereas it goes down in villages. On the other hand, cities are more worried about how to recycle their rubbish than in villages.\n\nTo resolve this trouble, my village has created a plan to teach its population how important it is to take care of the environment and how to do it. For this reason, we have new containers to separate all rubbish: we have to throw away bottles, cans and cartons into the yellow; paper and cardboard go to the blue and there is another one for glass. Food and other things are thrown into the green container. The council also has put over one hundred bins around the village to keep clean our streets.\n\nAt the school, children are learning how to spend less water or electricity at home. Turn off the lights when you don't stay in a room or do not waste water while you are brushing your teeth are some of advice.\n\nI hope these simple actions can be used for other people because the environment needs that we work together for a better world.",

Afterwards, take the bridge over the lakes and enjoy a full day of shopping. Lining the streets are small second-hand shops, cafes, markets and boutiques that are daily visited by the local people. If you get tired of wondering the streets then you can always enter the big shopping store Magasin for more indoor shopping. The shops close at around six and eight o'clock in the evening. When you are tired of shopping take the bus to the West Side of Copenhagen where there is a vast choice of restaurants, everything from Italian to Chinese to Danish cuisine.

  "text": "Do we need fashion?\n\nFashion, a popular topic. We all wear clothes, do we? And most people think about what they wear, although some don't care about there clothing. What happens when we all just have to wear the same clothes? Do we really need fashion? I talked about this topic with a few other students and asked them what there opinion is. In the following paragraphs I'll tell you what they told me.\n\nThe first question we discussed was: 'Does it exist just to make money for clothing designers and manufactures?' Their opinios first varied a bit here. An argument some called was:'In case we remove this whole industry, then there would be an humangous group of peoole unemployed, and that would be a problem.' The others answered on this with the question: 'When does a company starts making something, just because they want something to do?' This question made the other group doubt a bit, they did agree that a company doesn't just start making something to have something to do. This made them all agree that fashion is there for a reason, and not only for money.\n\nNext question we talked about the following question:'Does it have too much effect on models?' They didn't have to think about their opinion, they all directly said 'Yes'. They told that if you wanted to be a model, you had to fit in a size of clothing which is really small. There is immense group of girls who really want to be a model, caused by the fact that they don't fit in this clothing yet they have to lose weight. Much girls are losing too much weight right then because they want to be 'perfect' and got anorexia and those things.\n\nThe following question which we talked about was:'Does it have too much influence on young people?' Here they all directly responded with a 'yes' too. In their opinion young people, also themselves, were very busy with fashion and clothes. An example on which they all agreed was:'In case you just met your new class, and you had to choose next to who you had to sit the most people were going to sit next to the girl or boy with the trendy clothes'. Some said that it even happened that people just bought a particular kind of clothing, just because they thought they would have more friends then.\n\nThe next question was:'Does it make society materialistic and competitive? The students were a bit doubting but agreed on the fact that people who have stylish clothes are usually the most popular. And there're a lot of people who want to be popular, so they are going to buy trendy clothing. \n\nThe last and probably the most difficult question we discussed was:'Does it affect the way you dress and the kinds of clothes you buy?' They all said it kind of did affect however they also bought clothes they liked. I asked them the question:'If you liked a piece of clothing but your friends didn't, would you then have bought it?' They all said yes, but with a little doubt. \n\nSo, we do kind of need fashion. But where do we decide on which clothes we wear? And do you have to like your clothes or someone else? Maybe we should keep in mind that we should wear clothes in which we feel okay.\n",

  "text": "REPORT ON SHOPPING FACILITIES IN MY TOWN\n\nThe reason Lagos remains a mega city is because of its abundant tourist centers. The beautiful seaside and natural games reserve or Zoo makes it very attractive to tourist visitors. A pleasurable tourism is not complete without a fascinating shopping center that has several facilities.\n\nATTRIBUTES OF SHOPPING FACILITIES\nThere are lots of shopping centers in my town with their own unique characteristics. These include facilities like ample vehicle parking lots with very low charges or almost free of charge, elevator systems to access any area of the shopping malls in the case of carrying very heavy loads of purchases and relaxation spots like Cinemas and gaming centers for kids. In addition,most shopping malls do have enough space for their customers to move around without getting any clustering of people; as this is a statutory requirement to building a shopping mall.  \n\nSHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONS\nAs a matter of fact, Shop-rite is one of the best place in my opinion, that I would advise people to visit. It products are more international and they offer a lot of discounts to tourist visitors. Besides, this shop is not too far from the known natural games reserve in Lekki area of Lagos.\n\nAnother shopping center is the magnificent Lagos Island market. This is where you would find several shops that sell most African traditional artifact. I will rather advice tourist to pay this market a visit to enable them have choices of priceless products.\n\nCONCLUSION\nI hope from the explanations, I have been able to convince you with respect to my opinion about the shopping centers in my town and their possible facilities that abounds as you take your time in considering visiting them.

I think that travelling by car is also more inner and comfortable because you only travel with people you know. Talking about money probably car is more convenient, even if you have to pay for fuel, highway and everything that is necessary to the maintenance of the car. As a result, if you use public transport, you have to pay an expensive subscription and different tickets. There is no future for public transport because buses and trains are broken and dirty and people prefer to avoid them. So people prefer travelling with their own means of transport instead of paying to travel in a terrible way. On the other hand, if we don't use public transport and every person use a car, pollution will increase a lot. We can also say that with cars you have to find a parking, so you can waste time and sometimes pay for that.

I mean people watch television to entertain themselves but others maybe watch it to learn a new language with different programs that television offers or just put subtitles to make it simple. A lot of important news can be shown to people around the world by TV. It's important to know what it's happening in the world because it can enrich your knowledge culturally, politically, etc. Besides you need to know if a conflict is developing at the moment or if many severe situations are being occurred in your country. Children learn a lot of things with cartoons, it can help them to improve the speaking and to know new vocabulary. The television is one of the most important media. So, for that reason I think  television can entertain and also educate.\nI'd like to add that television can be the refuge of a person if it's sad or the break of someone's on its free time. Watching TV can be funny and nice but watching it in excess can be bad and not healthy for your life.",

  "text": "I always believe I can become an engineer and computer technician to invent more things since I was small. After I receive more and more information about some successful engineer and inventor such as Steve Jobs, I realize that no matter who you are and how smart you are, you cannot live without a healthy body. Consequently, I believe physical development is the necessity in secondary school life and I was so grateful for providing me opportunities of extra-curricular activities. \nI like the feeling of getting sweat and a great passion in swimming. Therefore, to maintain my body healthy and my interest, I keep on joining the School Aquathon since I was secondary one. I participated the same events each year. It allows me know my body state and whether I have relapsed. Besides it gave me a motion to train harder and never have a thinking of giving up that I need to keep my swimming training every year and reminds me of the importance of a healthy body. Also, under the harsh training, it trains my willpower and setting goal. I learnt setting a proper goal as it is a significant factor to success. This goal push me forward to do better and better each time. I realized that you will make a concession if you do not improve after take part in School Aquathon and saw others got improved but not just me.\nI reckon learning and trying more kinds of things can change my school life to become more colorful. School work and examinations gave me huge pressure so I found a way to strike a balance that I learnt playing windsurfing. In my eyes, windsurfing is special and indispensable to me. When I step on the surfing board, all my vexation and misgiving were gone. Under the recommendation of my instructor, I joined the Joint school windsurfing competition. On that day I found something wrong with my position on the result board. I was shocked and decided protest for the wrongdoings of the race committee. After several meetings, I got my position back and I have learnt that we should believe ourselves. Also I got trained my body and become more healthy.\nThe hottest issue nowadays is the global warming. Therefore I paid more attention at global warming and ways to deal with it. It is part of my dream that I wish I can have an invention to solve the problem in the future. To know more information having a green lifestyle, I participated in the Green & Organic Health Run 2013. Also, I learnt communication skills with friends. One of the purpose of this event is to encourage running to have a healthy lifestyle, so I got a better physical development.\nTo have more different experience, I have joined the “Dialogue in the dark” experiential exhibition. In the total dark environment, I experience the feeling of the visually disabled and the difficulties of their livings. After undergo this experience, I can totally understand their needs and I got my new goal of helping them in the future. I get a greater passions in engineering so as to create some device to help them to have a more comfortable life. Also I have learnt the communication skills with others and be considerate. \nUnder the colorful school life, I undergo different type of experience and I finally set my career goal to become an engineer or a computer technician. I think it is not a good engineer who only got skills of engineering. Therefore I reckon my experience can trained me to be admitted as a suitable candidate of engineering and I will work hard to achieve my goal.\n",

And , as a draback of being acelebrity, they are  followed by papparazzi almost everywhere. But don't they deserve to have more private life? \n I think that journalists should remember about the private life of famous people which is deserved to stay in secret for other people. There are a lot of cases known when journalists would make it difficult for a celebrity to leave some place because there were so many of those journalists. And for some people it doesn't really matter if it was found out that someone was in a bar for example as long as their films are really worth watching. Besides,being foollowed by unknown people ought to be quite a scary experience.\n Some people would say that it's necessary for usual people to know how the politician lives so they could know if he should be trusted. That's for sure an important thing to know for voters. But as for film stars, is it really necessary to know how exactly they live?",

When Michael and his little brother ,Jackson,  arrived at the park, noticed that there wasn't anybody around. The park was sealed by a green tape which said  \"danger zone keep away\" . Suddenly two people dressed as astronauts were leaving the park and advertised to the young boys to go to their house and wait until these unfortunately event was over. Tom and Jack were curious about what had happened but they didn't know from were to take answers. While they  were walking back home they heard a journalist commenting what incident have happened to the park. The only thing they could clearly heard was: - But this can only be caused by the contamination, although these windy day hasn't helped.\nJackson stopped walking and get distracted by a beautiful dog, Michael continued on his way unaware Jackson wasn't following him.Almost arriving at home and mulling over the thoughts take his own conclusions to what could might have happened. And wanted to share them with jack but... \nMichael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.\n",

What I think it's stupid is that most people use to hide their faces from behind the screen and no one wants to appreciate a sunny day anymore!\n What I disagree about this video is because he is generalizing too much. I think it is cool to have a social network, and there is nothing wrong to let kids enjoy the technology that became part of our generation. However, they must be controlled and especially by their parents. I believe the old values should have been taught for children in schools. \n  The thing nowadays is, if you disconnect from all of the things we have, people make fun of you and say that you are old or just don't know how to deal with the modern world. Well, it is possible actually, just like we did in the 1990s.\n I've experienced this, so that's why I am saying. The internet has caused me depression once, I felt really alone and I used to be someone who I wasn't in the real life, but I learned how to deal with it.

  "text": "Thriller name: Killer shadow\nThe review:\nJack Pollard a street fighter known as Crazy dog lives downtown LA. He has enemies who want to kill him. One night when he is walking aimlessly in a privacy alley he sees a shadow which gradually comes to him. At first he doesn’t care but suddenly sees it in front, an owner-less shadow. He turns his head around to find the source of shadow but can’t find anything so he feels fear but controls himself and yells: who are you? Hey if it’s a kidding, stop it, it’s not funny. Suddenly, shadow covers him and crazy dog falls on the ground and dies. The police announced checkout is the murder motivation. A detective named James Reilly wants to find out the reason for murder and to arrest murderer. He realizes crazy dog killed an innocent man named Joe Mendez last year but his body was not found. In Mendez house in the suburb, Reilly found some old photos showing the sequel of criminals. They all were tortured viciously before death. It was around 9 PM when Reilly was there. Suddenly he hears a weak voice whispering; do not try to stop the shadow, let it kill the criminals or you’ll die. He checks everywhere but can’t find anyone. He sees a shadow out of the house and follows it until it stands at the end of graveyard. He goes there and sees a pile of garbage quickly brushes aside it and observes a hole in the ground. He goes inside it and discovers a half decayed body that was compatible with Mendez identities. He understands that the shadow was ghost of Mendez who wanted to take revenge on Mendez’s murderer. \nI think this thriller is exciting because it shows a ghost with killing ability. I think since this idea is creative people will like to watch it.  \n\n",

  "text": "Introduction\n\nThe purpose of this report is to describe the shopping facilities in Pamplona, and to outline some recommending shops that might appeal tourists with different interests.\n\nShopping Facilities\n\nAs might have been expected, a main city as Pamplona is well equipped to deal with a large number of tourist and residents going shopping. Within the town centre itself there is a wide selection of stores offering local crafts, fashion clothing, food or wine. In addition, several car parks have space for 2000 automobiles and are conveniently located on the centre with easy access and cheap rates. There is also an extensive local bus network in order to provide services to all the suburbs around the city. \n\nSpecial shops\n\nAlthough most tourists come to Pamplona for the famous festival of \"Bulls Running on the street\", many become passionite about the cuisine of Navarra. As a result, a few shops such as \"LA VINOTECA\" and \"DELICIUS\" have dedicated to selling selected top wines and typical food. Both shops are located in \"Castillo Square\" and their staff speak English. \nMoreover, a store known as \"KUXUMUSU\" offers all kinds of bulls-related souvenirs and genuine pieces that explain the Basque Country's culture.\n\nRecommendations for tourists\nI would strongly recommend that any tourist, no matter about their interest, should visit the special shops aforementioned. There is little doutbt that they will not only find original products, but will also enrich their minds.\n\n\n",

On the other hand, they are still normal peolple, who have families, partners and friends and they sometimes want to have a few private minutes, without cameras, media, newspapers, flashes and spotlights. Probably, they want to go on holidays without recognise by other people, without giving autographs and taking photos. Moreover, from time to time they prefer to leave house without make up and beautiful clothes. Wahat is more, I am sure, that most of them do it on purpose because their main aim is the famuos. And celebrities well know that they have to be controversial cause that is the best way to achieve their lovely famous. So big names try to go somewhere without guards, without make ups to show themselves to cause some juicy gossip about them to gain famous in the easiest way.

New technologies are changing the way of thinking private cars in a new much more save and ecological way. \n\nOn the one hand, public transport is well known by their large amount of benefices like less pollution and more economical aspects. Moreover, large crowded cities using underground or bus are usually a good way to avoid traffic jams, saving time and stress of sad drivers during commutations. \nFor that reason, fomenting the use of public transport has been the main concern of most of modern governments. \n\nOn the other hand, huge technological improvements in car features like self-driving, electrical engines, solar power and others, have created a new perspective of conceiving the way we interact with cars. \nUsually, cars need one hundred percent of our attention during driving. Resulting as a huge disadvantage of cars compared to public transport because we are not able to enjoy driving time by doing something else at the same time we are driving. However, that is really close to change by Google's Self-Drive Car which is a new technology able to drive our car to any destination without humane intervention. Furthermore, the car could be empty and go anywhere we command. \nThat exiting news open a new world of possibilities for the use of cars.

Last month I was training at a concert by decorated the scene and seriously came out better then I expected to. The bulbs were red and the ground was full of yellow flowers. Seems simple but looks beautiful, sometimes the simplicity is the most perfect accessorise. I was happy helping those people, because money from the tickets were donated to a nursing house.\nNowadays people care more about themeselves and making good things for some of them is wrong!\nI'm sad when I see a nursing house but you know, there, people will never talk whether they do bad or good and in the end of the day, they will not care only about themselves and their insecurity. Being there is like having your own family.\nI hope, in the next project you'll be there helping us! We need more caring person!",

I think you could work as an entretainer in some tourist villages roun the country.\nIn that way you colud improve your way to make a relationship with people and also it could be a great help for your theatrical experience.\nI know that you are a brilliant photographer and that you want to improve your hability, so I think that you could do some photos during your trip and then you could send them to some experts.\nHonestly I think that it could be hard (just because you haven't so much time ) but I know that sooner or later there will be a photo event... It's not much but you can start from it to let other people know about your talent.\nI hope that my advices will help you and I also hope that you have a great time in my country !!\nLet me know if you enjoy yout tour and take lots of photos ( I want to see them soon ) \nLots of kisses\nMarty\n",

  "text": "Nowadays, people have different viewpoints about whether the most principle concern of choosing an occupation is salary. Personally, I disagree with that the money is the most important consideration for deciding a job, because there are several factors equally important.\n\nI believe that other considerations are as important as money. Firstly, the core values and the reputation of the company are necessarily concerned. Working in a company which is built up with good core values and has an excellent reputation could easily obtain the fulfillment and keep passion in job for a long time. We would believe that this job is worth contributing to for life. Secondly, the co-worker relationship and the atmosphere in the workplace are extremely important when choosing a job. Having a kind boss or friendly colleagues, for example, can bring workers the senses of belonging and enjoyment from working, hence the working quality may arise greatly.\n\nAdmittedly, money is necessary for people's daily lives, satisfying their basic demand. For example, the expenditure of food, drinks and commodities need the support from the steady income. Furthermore, we may need much more money to have some activities, such as worldwide travel or outdoor camping for days. In addition, in the life-long consideration, health-care would be increasingly important with people getting older, hence enough amount of money as a stable income could not be disregard.\n\nIn conclusion, while salary still plays a role and certainly affects people's choice of profession, I believe that money does not outweigh all the other factors.",

  "text": "Karate gave me a new purpose of life. This is one reason why it is my most favorite sport. There are various reasons why I am absolutely fascinated by this martial art. Behind every single movement you will find gracefulness and power. Once entering a class, you are able to fully concentrate on the sport. There are certain procedures in the beginning of a class which encourages you to empty your mind and be ready for class. Especially in our hectic world it is very important to find to yourself and just listen to your body.\nAs a martial artist you start to get a great fitness and your balance will improve a lot as well as your flexibility. Many characteristics will increase immensely such as confidence, self-defense or responsibility. You will find that you will not only benefit from those in your normal life, but also in your job.\n\nKarate can be started by anyone and any age. However to see any improvements you should attend regularly and at least twice a week. Only then it starts to make great fun and you certainly will not regret that you have taken it up. Enjoy!!",

How about going out with me and my friends? We can see each other in the centre and then we visit the city all together. \nApril is a very nice month. Although the weather can change more easily, so you should bring different kinds of clothes both heavy and light. The perfect outfit can be a pair of trousers, a t-shirt and a jacket. \nThanks a lot for your invitation and if I wasn't so busy, I would travel around with you.

Besides, the phone did not work properly, it was imposible the use of it to call the receptionist.

  "text": "All about me\n\nHello! My name is Emma and I´m 13 years old. Now I am going tell you some facts about myself and my life. I was born here in Sweden, actually right here at Danderyds hospital, but I lived in the city back then. When I was about three years old we moved here, to Danderyd. I lived in a yellow house, not far away from where I live now (probably just five minutes) until a year ago when we moved to a much bigger house. I live here with my wonderful family based on my mum Aylin, my dad Tom, my two really annoying brothers Hans and Oliwer, and my two cats Tiger and Smilla. Hans is 10 years old and Oliwer is 7 years old. \n In the middle of the summer we always go to Gotland and stay at a farm, in a little house.\n\n I go by cycle to “Fribergaskolan” every day together with my friends Tekla, Julia and Bianca. I really think it is a great school with very kind teachers and students. I like to dance a lot. On Monday and Thursday I dance at a dance-school here, close to “Mörby Centrum”, called C-style. I dance a mixture of street dance and show dance. \n\nI also like riding horses, that is one of the thing I often do when we are at Gotland, by the way. Right now I'm actually in a riding course every Sunday. We are just three girl, and I think this kind of riding is so much more fun than riding at a stable with big groups and so on.\n\nI really like Spain, we have been there like six times and the reason is that my dad has a project there and sometimes he has to go there for a week or less and we have the luck to be able to join him. I really like to eat sushi and other Asian food, like noodles. My favorite restaurant is a restaurant in Stockholm at Östermalm called: “New Peeking” it´s an Asian buffé and they make the best food. \n\nMy favorite subject in school is probably Swedish, English or biologi. My favorite book is right now: “The fault in our stars” because its a really good subject and it is sad but great story. My favorite movie is maybe “TED” or “Grown ups” because they are really fun movies with some sad moments. \n\nOn the holidays and after school I´m often with my friends and family. I have a lot of friends in my new class and I knew almost everyone of them in my old school (called Kyrkskolan). One of my other big hobbies is photographing. I got one own camera, it´s a Canon. \n\nThe biggest accident in my life was probably when I was three years old. It was midsummer and my mum was outside on the terrace. I wanted to go out to her so I open the door on the wrong side by putting my long finger and ring finger in the little crevice. \nSuddenly a powerful wind make the door blow up and squeeze my finger really hard. I screamed and it started to bleed really much. My fingers were almost cut so my dad wrapped my fingers in bandage and we drove to the doctor as fast as we could.

For the most of men shopping is so boring and exhausting, but for the women it can be the best way to make better their mood, because they are so happy when they buy many clothes on sale, cheaper than in regular price. \nI think that the shopping is not enjoyable for everyone when in the shops are a crowd and very long queue.

  "text": "Friendship is one of the most valuable sentiments for people, especially for people who are in school days. Making new friends and sharing interests with others are always exciting parts of social life. When it comes to the best way for students to make friends, some support that participating in community activities or traveling are preferable, however, from where I am stand, joining a sports team is the undoubtedly the best choice.\n\nFirst of all, for the energetic students, doing sports is their favorite. Therefore, joining a sports team from where they can share same interests and relax is the easiest way to know each other. Training in the same sports team, the students cannot only release them from whole day's pressure, but also can build up good relationships with others through the communication and exercise. For example, the champions of Olympic Games, China's famous synchronized diving athletes, GuoJingjing and Wu Minxia, the two girls enjoy a really good friendship. They became to know each other because they both joined the same sports team, and then after exercised and played together; they finally become two enviable friends.\n\nAdditionally, cooperation and coherency are always the main essence of a sports team. Here, students learn how to work together, how to fight for the same goal through tacit teamwork, how to contribute to the whole team instead of just thinking of self, and even how to negotiate or discuss with others, as well as how to be patient and rational. Although there may be some argument or disagreement among students, I always think that everything is going to be okay because the sports team will be coherent. \n\nFinally, joining a sport team will provide a long period of time for students to get along with each other. However, if students participate in community activities, for example, doing volunteer job in the town's library, they would not have sufficient time to communicate with each other since most of their time is full of working. Meanwhile, students can play with each other during traveling, but only several days are deficient and most people will not keep in touch with others after the trip.\n",

At this mind-blowing place, we looked and gazed at the phenomenally awe-inspiring and unbelievable fossils of ancient dinosaur bones up to 100 meters high! We also made brilliant mini statues of a type of dinosaur, I did the T-Rex and my mate assembled a Raptor. I luxuriate the manufacture of the spellbinding models and the gift we get to pick in the dinosaur shop. I enjoyed this unforgettable experience to the meseum, and hope you can take your time out to go one day!\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\nJon",

So, two of us had to share one bed, which is hardly acceptable\nThe other problems is about the offered excursions: You promised a number of attractions, but two (the walk up to the mountain as well as the visit of a historic castle) were not available.\nUnfortunately, we also had problems with nutrition: In your brochure it was told that we will have a number of restaurants around, but in fact there was only one which was, in addition to that, really expensive. This is in our honest opinion not acceptable, because in the brochure you talked about more than one restaurant.\n\nTo sum it up: We were not very pleased with our holiday as we could not enjoy some of the things you promised to us in the brochure.

After sixteen years of continues work, it is the  perfect moment to take a rest and enjoy your life by travelling. To know about other cultures and get new knowledge completly different from school. However it could be a great time to work and earn some money for paying university or simply for saving it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe if we have a break until university the routine of working and studing every day could break. So when univerity starts, people will become busy, the routine will not be the same, and as a consecuences the marks will be lower.\n\nto conclude, I think after school we need apply for university in order to continue working in what we like. The year off should be taken after university studies",

  "text": "As the number of traffic accident has increased dramatically over the year, finding the best solutions has putted the government under pressure to whether implementing stricter penalties or using alternative regulations.Personally,road safety cannot be ensured with either former or later methods.Instead,it should be a combination of various actions.\nAs a matter of fact, severe punishments can partly decrease the rate of offences. Nobody wants to pay an expensive fine or spend time in prison, so fear of punishment might be effective and prevent people to make the offence a second time.Moreover,one’s penalty also can be considered as a mirror that people can look at and avoid doing the same things. The main offences are driving over the speed limits, drunk driving, driving without licences.Its penalties, depends on the severity, could include fines,licence suspension, community services or imprisonment.Consequently,those punishments make the drivers have to concentrate on driving only,therefore,minimize the amount of accidents.\nBy the same token, a sole method could not solve the traffic problems as driving offences are not the only reason that cause traffic accidents. Authorities should enact more safety policy on road and ensure by improving the quality of traffic facilities. In many developing countries, government rarely attach special important to both the quality and quantity of the traffic system, especially in rural areas. People easily get accidents when driving in narrowed or severely damaged streets.Furthermore,vehicle collisions are rising greatly due to number of unclear road signs. Traffic education is also an compulsory measure, especially to young generations as they cover majority of offences. People should be educated carefully about all the safety regulations and laws when they get driving licence,the more they know the rules, the less risks are taken on road.\nIn general, betterment of reducing traffic accidents is important.Therefore,it should be considered carefully on how to combine both severe penalties and many other regulations.\n",

  "text": "Public transportation once used to be a convenient and inexpensive way to transport oneself in the city. However, the increasing number of car ownership has been taken place of public transportation, providing more convenience to get around places to places. Traveling by cars gives flexibility in our schedule. We do not have to concern to catch a bus or train at certain time. We can get on a car whenever we want to go to places and drive. Such convenience of cars can enables us to use our time efficiently. However, cars cannot take place of public transportations just for that convenience. \nMaintaining cars is cost associative. Driving a car requires to fuel gas, and gas prices are becoming more and more expensive. In addition, cars require regular maintenance such as oil change and checking tire pressures. Mechanical problems can often be a costly problems. Unlike public transportation, one has to be responsible for his or her tool of transportation, and it could be expensive sometimes. On the other hand, the public transportation is inexpensive. Not to mention not everyone can afford keeping a car with their budget. \nIn other perspective, cars require to drive. Driving is not everyone can do. For example, people who have disabilities and certain diseases are not able to drive. Children under certain age are not permitted to drive. For those people, public transportation can be an optimal choice of transportation. \nIn conclusion, cars are convenient, however, it is not for everyone use. Therefore, the public transportation has its own means of existence, and there is a future for public transportation. ",

We  have a hugeexperience in organising seminars and camps for families with disabled children. For many of children participating in this camp is the only opportunity to spend time with the coevals and to feel fully-fledged members of the society. Words fail to express emotions that all participants experience. Health improvements  of some children can be considered a miracle. \nAll children get a lot of positive emotions spending time together and learning how to be tolerant.\nReduction in financial support from foreign charity foundations leads to make our camp not possible to happen this year. \nOur budget is fixed for only 75 people, it is almost twice a number of  participants last year. We don't know and we don't want to know how to refuse a participation in the camp to children in this situation! We want all our children to go to this camp, so we set up a donation project. The greater amount of money has already been collected thanks to the trustee board of \"NNN\" community, but we still need additional $13000. \nWe are asking you not to stay indifferent to disabled children and to provide feasible help.",

  "text": "(Essay)\n\nThe idea that newspapers will diminish by time due to people's perspective toward surfing the internet for the worldwide news does not necessarily mean that it can be taken for granted. One of  the most controversial issues nowadays is that a large sector of the society deals with newspapers as a daily routine. They can't withstand one day without skimming through their pages with a cup of tea in the morning. To the best of my knowledge, it is a way of behaving more than a way coping with the latest technologies.\n\nTo begin, the reason for decreasing the popularity of news papers is that most people, recently, rely on being online most of the time to follow the latest news all around the world. The second main reason is that online news is often free of charge. Thus, people read news at any time and for free. On the other hand, newspapers are presented in a definite place, with limited time in addition they are daily payable.\n\nWhile some may claim that credibility is the main reliable aspect of publishing. It is obvious that the daily newspapers having a respectful reputation are the ones which could be accepted by thousands of people. In this respect, newspapers seem to be more credible than numerous websites that make up fake stories much more than publishing real news. Furthermore, reading habits have their own taste, specifically for those elderly people. They enjoy turning the pages and reading the headlines using their eyeglasses. That marvelous tasteful generation can't be buried alive as they have their own experiences and influences upon the modern society.\n\nIn light of the forgoing discussion, it appears to be true that the internet is an incredible aspect toward globalisation even in daily news worldwide. However, the newspapers still have their lead in that perspective. It can be suggested that combination of both arenas will positively influence the ways of delivering news.",

It has almost everything that you need in a cafe, comfortable chairs and sofas, beatiful features and a really good-taste coffee that they serve in most of twenty different ways and with all toppings you can think in. Althoug the most important thing is that there were not only friendy staff but they look like if they were having tea in Wonderland, with Alice and the White Rabbit.\n\nI strongly recommend this café if you want to enjoy an excellent coffee with a careful decoration and brilliant performances in which you can participate while having a drink. You will love it!!\n",

  "text": "When facing a decision on whether to shop in a shopping center or in small stores, many people will choose the shopping center because you can buy all types of products at once. Others, including myself, believe that shop in small stores is the premium choice. In the following essay, I will outline two reasons to support my view.\nFirst, small stores provide products with more unique feature and different selection. That is to say, most small stores may have their own logos on mugs or even T-shirts and it is more likely to find handmade products in it. For instance, my friends once bought a nice scruff with cute animal figure in a small store and I really like it after she showed me. Therefore, the next day she brought me back to the store, we found out that they did not have the same scruff because it is the only one. Although I was disappointed that I could not have the same scruff but this is the fun part that shop in small stores, you can always find something unique.\nSecond, it is true that shop in a shopping center is fast and convenient because one can buy all types of things together. However, most shopping center provide limited selections and sometimes the price is expensive.\nIn conclusion, I prefer to shop in a small stores because it is more likely to find the one and the only product while it also provides a sense of treasure hunting.",

Them jokes were very funny. However, there are a couple of small sugestions. First of all, the vanue itself was very crowded and parking almost impossible to find. It could be a good idea to find a large location. I saw a parents with children but kids did not have many attractions. I would like to suggest fire special animators wgo will entertain kids.

  "text": "These days, the use of technology is increasing, especially robots. According to Russell and Norwing robots are especial machines that have intelligence to executed activities on their own or by command (as cited in Chijindu & Inyiama, 2012). They represent an innovation that has changed the world in distinct ways and have implanted in different areas of society; for example in security, health, army forces, education, industries and agriculture. Consequently, positive and negative social impacts can be observed by the population. More accurate surgeries, emotional bond and increase of communication are examples of positive consequences. Negative impacts such as the human dependence on robots for doing basic activities and pollution of environment can be cited. This essay will describe the positives and negatives social consequences of the robots, and possible implications in the future.\n",

  "text": "Each day, the environment suffers different problems caused by the global warming and human are the unique guilty of this issue. We need to analyze and investigate the main problems to find solutions which may get better our world.\nFirst of all, transport is the most relevant carbon dioxide´s emitter. As we know, in all cities a lot of cars are used every day unnecessarily. Probably, if we used up public transport like bus instead of private, we would reduce the greenhouse effect because of the CO2 produced.\nSecondly, the huge amount of litter floating in the rivers and sea´s water destroys the ecosystem and has a high visual impact. Sometimes, cities get rid of rubbish throwing it to the water. An easy answer could be building more landfills.\nLast, I´ll propose a solution of a common and near problem. Reusing things that we don´t utilize (like clothes, furniture…) and give them a `second life´. I think we must be down to earth and creative to cut down our daily trash´s production.\nTo sum up, it´s necessary to solve the environmental problems to keep safe our planet, so we had better start resolving closer issues.

  "text": "Dear Jo, \n\nI'm happy that you wrote me to ask some advice. Well, to travel there in Brazil, you have to choose some places to go, because here we have a lot of beautiful places to visit and have fun. To help you, I need to know what do you prefer to do. If you want to go to the beach, I'll tell you to visit the Northeast's beaches because there are the most beautiful beaches in the entire world. You have to pass some days in Fernando de Noronha. For these places, the best season is the Summer. One other place to visit in Summer is the pantanal. There you will see one of the most beautiful biome that you have seen. In pantanal the weather ir hot and wet, and we can drive into the river deeper in the wood and see the wild animals like the alligators.\nIf you want to come here in the Winter, you have to know the South. There, you will see beaultiful cities with European architecture and you will find nice wine factories.\nFor work, I advise you came to Sao Paulo. Here, you'll find most of kinds of temporary job, like in restaurants, bars, etc.\nI hope that I helped you and see you soon.\n",

Over 1 billion people around the world speak English as a second language because of that it is considered the universal language. Nowadays, it is an obligation to get a better job. I will discuss the importance of English as a second language in Brazil.\n   Even though, study a language become easier because of the internet, fluency is harder to get when you study by yourself. Brazillians need learn English because it opens doors in business and in higher education. In Brazil, regular schools teach for students the basic aspects of the language and do not let them emerge in the language. It can explain a little bit of Brazil's lack of English speakers. Learn English as a foregein language will make a huge impact in brazillians' professional life to get a better position.\n   To conclude, Brazil has deficiency of English speakers. The brazillian educational system should be aware to develop more students' language skills. Learn English as a second language will help brazillians to get a better job and have more opportunities in their careers. It is a rich, graceful and delightful language to learn.",

Only a few seconds separated her from the jump to the water. The judge ordered to take place at the sites. Anna looked again toward the audience, where her the best fans in the world were sitting - her parents, friends, coach and friends. They all were keeping their fingers crossed. She swam so fast, like a former fish, not a human being. In the water she feels like at home.

I personally think so, the reasons are as below:\n\nFirst, As we all know, Cars play a very important role in our life, the more and more cars come into our family.  Also travelling, of course, that's a big part of the function of the car! The very well developed highways, roads, city streets provide a good foundation for the cars, look at the North America, the highways were developed anywhere, it's really your own lose if you don't drive a car, drive on them(highways)\n\nSecond, Human start to learn driving at the age of 16, and they can master the driving skills very quickly( within a month or two), soon they can drive to wherever they want to go, and we also see people at the age of 80 still drive to their destinations as they got used to it. so who care to bother taking the public transportation anymore?  \n\nThird, The public transportation sucks, when you think about it, you can picture the crowded subways, dirty buses, and the difficulty/hussults between the public transportation transfer in your mind. The wasted time also should weight in, whether it is waiting for the trains, or waiting for the delayed buses, not to mention the longer time it takes compared to travelling in a car. And driving your own car can be very convenient too, it can right come to your own garage.\n\nAll in all, Public transport is not as fast as a car can be; it's not as convenient as a car can provide, so it's future is in doubt.\n\n",

  "text": "        I agree with this statement that being safe is better than feeling sorry. There are the three following reasons.\nFirstly, no one like to be sad. Life is full of good things why don't we look to the full side of the cup instead of looking at the empty one ?  Being sad and sorry will destroy your life ,because you will not be able to work , eat and live in a good way. All of this will affect your life badly , maybe you will lose your job or your health will not be good anymore.\nSecondly, Eveybody seeks safetiy in their lives. Look around you , crimes and death are srounding us , all this people are dreaming to live a peaceful life without all the aspects of killing and sadness.People are fighting as they can to only  reach a calm life where everyone of them can be safe.\nThirdly, I lived two years  without feeling safe and comfortable . The war in my country make me feel no longer safe. For that reason I beleive that being safe is  absloutly better than sorry. I will always remember my dad telling me to calm down , saying that the life will go on and oneday  all of us  will  be satsfied with this life.\nIn conclusin, I think that all of us should see through rose -tinted glasses and be happy ,because you live a calm life without anything makes you sorry.",

But are these new comers will be placed by public transport?\n\nAs technology enhanced the life system in any way possible, people become more dependent and can't avoid it beacuse of many different attractions that these cars have. Another reason for using their own car is that easy access in a second. Furthure more, there are advantages travelling by a car, like seeing the scenery and also the costs is less in compare to plane.\n\nBut it's not possible that every one have and use their own car. In this case there will be a huge chaos. Trafic jam will cost a lot, such as pollution which certainly cause more health problems and will make expense not only for us but for the others as well.\n\nThe solution is public transport again, which enhance the pace of life and make easy accsess by subways and special roads. On the other hand, by increasing the population we should revise the regulation with the fast pace of technology.\n\nTo sum up, as thought the cars are too covenient to some extend, but the cost will reduce the benefit. So for sure we will use public transport but maybe with some changes.\n",

  "text": "\"Atacama 33\"\n\"Atacama 33\" is a recent American movie that tells the real story of a group of miners that keep trapped in a mine 700 metres underground in Chile for two months. This group had a leader called Mario Casas starring Antonio Banderas.\n\nThe film is well-developed and shows the audience every little issue and difficulty that miners had to go through. However the first 17 days in the movie could turn a bit tedious because the director focused in every single feeling of the trapped men and their families. After that lapse the rescuers found the place where the miners were hiding and the moment for rescue them started.\n\nThe characters were perfect as soon as they were people from Chile and Bolivia that were involve with the real accident. Antonio Banderas made an excellent work acting as a desperate leader committed with the local people.\n\nDespite some details, I think you can't miss this film if you want to know the truth of the recent miracle called \"the Chilean miners\".

What is more, we can only have to press one computer key to find what we are searching.

I think it is a bohemian trip too because the train use to be one of the most appreciated means of transport in the literacy. When you take a train, you can read and feel like Phileas Fogg in \"Around the world in 80 days\". I feel better when I travel over ground because I have fear of heights. Although experts say the plane is the safest means of transport, I continue thinking It is very dangerous. Probably, I'm afraid of planes because the media use to show plane accidents more often. The boat is a very beautiful way to travel, but I'm sure when I travel by boat in the future, I'll feel anxiety because I'll be surrounded by water. In conclusion, my main problem is the concern about how safe is the means of transport that I take, so, the train let me to be more relaxed than other ways to travel. ",

To get to the place they were holding the workshop in you had to come to the Chester Beatty library and then the guides arrived and led you to it. On the way there everyone who participated in the workshop stopped to buy some snacks. We were told to choose biscuits and the guides paid for us. When we reached the workshop the kids and I were told to put on protective glasses and given booklets with the instructions. We were taught how to solder two wires together and how to solder a wire to a vero board. We were instructed to make a badge that flashed different coloured light by using solder to attach the led and battery hatch to the badge. Then we had to follow the instructions in the booklet to make the synthesizer. At first I was quite confused but then one of the instructors came and helped me out. After that we had a snack and then went on to assemble all the parts together. We put them in metal boxes and turned them on. Each synthesizer emitted a loud noise. When the light sensor is in the shade, the synthesizer emitts a lower pitch, and when the sensor is exposed to light the synthesizer's pitch raises. ",

The lecturer answers back, saying that different types of medicine have different impact on different species. Secondly, the author suggests that it is impossible to replace experiments on animals with anything else. The lecturer disagrees with that point of view, because it is possible to introduce computer substitution or do research on tissues.

  "text": "The topic of the two passages is about future use of hydrogen based fuel-cell engine. The article states that the most efficient substituer of internal-combustion engines will be fuel-cell engines, because of their several advantages, while the lecture refutes this point by stating hydrogen does not have so many advantages.\n\nFirst of all, the reading passage says that internal-combustion engine relies on petroleum, which will be depleted soon, but hydrogen will not deplete easily. The professor contends this point by explaining that hydrogen is, in fact, not easily found. She adds that it is not directly usable, because hydrogen should be obtained in pure liquid state, which technologically is very hard to be kept under -200 degrees celsius.\n\nSecondly, the article states that this hydrogen use will solve pollution problems, inasmuch as it does not use carbon dioxide, but water. The professor contradicts the idea by saying that will not solve the pollution problem, because it requires to be purified in order to be used. She explains that in the process of purefication, a big amount of coal and oil is burned, which pollutes factories rather than the environment.\n\nFinally, the article says that the use of hydrogen is highly economic, because it requires only half of the energy of internal-combustion powered cars. The professor says that the claims in untrue, because the material, from which the cells are produced, is very expensive. She explains platinum is very hard to find and without this metal it is impossible to produce hydrogen. ",

I went with her and I waited for her the whole lesson. It means that after some months I was able to read the sheet music. \n\nBut a few months before the play, disaster occurred! My sister had fallen down her bike and hurt her wrist. Unfortunately, she could no longer play. The teacher said to me ‘Could you play in the place of your sister? You are able to read the sheet music and I think you will learn to play the piano in a while.’ I was absolutely terrify as I had to show. However, the teacher persuaded me to try to play the piano. Only then did I realise that I was keen on playing. As a result I spent the time playing the piano until I felt far more confident.\n\nThe day of the concert I was so nervous that I couldn’t stop walking. But when I started, I relaxed and felt like I was the only person in the theatre. At the end of the play, everybody applauded, never felt I so well.\n\nI am going to play definitely the piano for a long time.\n",

  "text": "Hi Jo,\nI'm glad to read you and I wish you to come to Russia for you holidays. You know that Russia is a big country and there are a lot of places to visit. In our country there are few different climate zones with very rich nature, various cities with old and prominent history and culture. I'm pretty sure that your journey to Russia will be a very good and interesting experience. First of all, you can come to Moscow. As you know, Moscow is the capital of the Russian Federation, it`s a very fast, energetic city with lots of things to do and to see. In the city there are a lot of museums and art galleries, theaters and clubs, few parks which priveds different events like open-air concerts or public muster-classes. Of course, you must visit Red Square, the Kremlin and Saint Basil's Cathedral. I strongly recommend you to book on-line tickets to Big Theater and visit it's opera or ballet. You know the Big Theater is one of the oldest in Russia with very rich traditions of ballet school. Maybe you remember the famous Diagelev's seasons which were popular in Europe in the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays artists of the Theater try to keep that old school and develop their mastery. In addition,few years ago the Big Theater was restored and had gained it's original appearance. \nThere is no necessity to describe all sightseeing in Moscow, you easily can find it in the Internet, I just want to say that I'm sure, you'll like it a lot. \nAfter Moscow you can visit town of the Gold Ring. It's a range of the oldest Russian cities which were centers of the principalities during the ancient period of Russian history. Here you can feel the spirit of antiquity and the huge contrast between Moscow and provincial Russia. You will understand that people here and there are very different and styles of their lives are dissimilar.      ",

People were really excited about the show they just has three attire changes but the show was amazing,  the lights and the sound was fantastic.  I couldn't wait to listen to my favorite song until they played it,  it was the best experience ever,  I wish you could be there to see that.  \nHope you have the chance to see each other next month. \nWtite soon \nRegards.  \nTerry ",

  "text": "Some people claim that universities and colleges should not spend a great deal of money on sports and social activities, as their budgets should prioritize classes and libraries. However, as educational institutions, universities and colleges have an obligation to provide a wide range of knowledge to their students to help them develop academically and socially.\n\n let us look at an example for a univesity student. The student had a great deal of assighment and projects, so he spent more time to access the libabry, becoming more ambition to study books and using a computer to search latest information. Sometimes he felt tired to do papers, going the gym to play basketball. Therefore, not only did he get high score in the reports that absorbinge a great deal of knowledge at the libabry, but reduce the study stress and maintain healthy in the gym. \n\n       I had a similar experience. when I studied in the university, I sit in the classes hour by hour in a day. When I finished classes, I would like to access the health center not only to do exercises, but I could maintain healthy. University, I also have a lot of assighments, so I like to go to libabry to study where is more quietly, spacious and internet accessible. That's why I like to go to school in terms of good facilities and widespread information to facilitate me to be a successful person. Sports and social activities can greatly improve my efficiency. In addition, my academics education also stand out in my student life.  \n\n      For these reasons, I maintain that universities and colleges should spend enough money on academic education and social movements to prepare students for their future development. Academic education will always be at the heart of a university. In universities, sports and social activities should by no means take the place of a focus on academic study. I believe that universities and colleges should spend adequate budget on academics as well as sports and social activities. ",

Many times when people leave high school and they go to University, they realised after several months that the career they had chosen it is not for them. In the other hand when teenagers take a year off is helpful for them to become mature. You can work, travel, going to an exchange study, rest and do something that you are interested.

Advent of science, whether it is in the scientific research or in the designs of consumer products, has changed our lives and will definitely keep changing our lives in the future.\n\nIpad, smartphone, genetic food engineering, all of them have one thing in common -they changed our lives dramatically.  Take genetic engineering as an example, on the one hand, it helps farmers to produce more corps and meats, on the other, it makes people believe that scientists can help in finding more efficient ways in producing more corps and poultry in the future, resulting in an unprecedent increase in human population, which brings pollution to the environment.\n\nTo cope with the problems of over-population and pollution, people need to dramatically change their lives in the next 50 years: they may, among other things, face tight birth control and environmental protection measures imposed by the government.

If the government provide good transport infrastructure like modern and comfort buses, traffic free Metro lines then people would rather to use public transport than travelling by car.\nNow a days worlds are facing the big issues like climate change and carbon emission. Government should promote the good mode of transport in order to reduce carbon emission and people would be encouraging to go green.\nMany times because of huge traffic congestion on road we waste our time. while using public transport like Metro save our times.\nThere are many city in world, planning to car free days and promote to use of public transport.",

First, shopping complexes  are full of branches of big chain-stores, so this can be boring to walk through them for a long time. Second, if you can't control your shopping habits, you  will buy more and more things you don't need, so that you can have a problem with your budget.

  "text": "CONTRIBUTION TO A LONGER PIECE\n\nI always love writing. I have always loved reading. You never know what you are going to find when you are reading (or writing) and less if you are doing it on the Internet. There are such an interesting websites and blogs where you can find out something very useful that you would have never expected or unsurprisingly , missinformation. \n\nWHY BLOGS APPEAL TO BOTH READERS AND WRITERS\n\nMany people will find blogs and websites useful in order to meet new people. We now that making social contacts can be sometimes a problem for a wide range of people, who sometimes find it a lonely and dauting experience. However, on the internet you can find not only meeting points but practical and very thought-provoking articles in blogs. In my experience, being under the screen of a personal computer will you be able to show and exchange ideas or opinions easily as if you have to do in front of someone else. \n\nHowever, both readers and writers not only do it as an altruistic and philantropic way but to get fame and popularity at the same time. Blogs and websites could give them the chance to became famous if they really appeal to a large amount of people and they will abe also available to earn money thanks to the publicity . Consequently, we should never blind trust in everything we see or read on the Internet. \n\nTHE BLOG I FOLLOW\n\nTo give an example, I usually follow a blog whose main task is to inform about novelties of new and old series, characters, new seasons and when they will be ready to watch them again. If they give us reliable information or not, it usually depends on the source. That's the point of Internet. You mustn’t take everything into account.\n\n\nTo clarify what the situation is, it is truth that not everybody may be interested in blogs or websites but the fact is writing or reading in a blog could give to people a practical way to communicate and share preferencies, beliefs or thoughts, however, more or less reliable.\n",

My brothers, nieces and nephew are an important part of my life, so I am always playing with them. I often try to play with the children interesting games, I think the games are a funny way to teach interesting things both children and older people, that is why I invent new methods to introduce the science in the children´s lives. The favorite game for my brothers is called \"coca boom\", with this game I showed them what is the chemistry, we cough a \"Coke\" and \"Mentos\" sweets then I put the \"Mentos\" into the \"Coke\" and I taught what happens when you mixed two substances.\nAlso, I think I would be a good person for the job because I like the Nature, I could teach them a lot of things about the Geology, a camp is perfect to introduce at the boys and girls in the stones and minerals. \nI would be happy if you considered me in the case there are vacancies.",

I have three dogs, one at my dad and two at my mom. Their names are Harry, Alice and Bonti. Bonti is very old she is 13 and she are feeling pretty bad, so I don’t think she will be alive so much more. Harry and Alice are seven and one years old. I play basketball on my free time and hanging out with my friend from my old school. We all have things in common like driving scooter. We have a lot of fun. \nI have moved a lot in my life, as I said before that my parents are divorced and because of that I have moved a lot. \n\nMy favorite place on earth is Hawaii. I will never forget that trip. On our hotel there was like a water park, it was enormous. That trip made me a lot of friends, I'm still holding the contacts with them and this trip was two summers ago. We all liked it so much so we are thinking going back there sometime. there was this amazing beach, we could hire paddle boards, snorkel gear, kayaks and other fun water things. and one day my mom and I went out early and hired a kayak and went out on the water and we saw sea turtles. I had hired a snorkel gear and a water camera, so I took pictures of sea turtle on the bottom. After a week we went home. \n\nMy favorite book is the hungergames. When I got it I read it five hours in a row. I like that book so much because it is pretty realistisk and it can happen in real world sometime. It’s pretty scary of all that happens in the book, all dead bodies and hurt people. But if you haven't read it I suggest you to read it. \n\nMy favorite tv series is called Lost. I have seen all episodes and I still watching it because it's so good. I like it so much because it’s dramatic, action and adventure. It’s does actually reminding me of my favorite video game, which is called Minecraft you must have heard about it. Everything is made of blocks and you can build and play with friends. \n\nI have played many sports in my life, like football, golf and tennis. I have played tennis since I was four years old. But I played basketball and my tennis at the same time, so I chose basketball, because I think it's fun.\n",

  "text": " \nVisiting museums is essential parts of their travel to new places for many people. Besides seeing touristic or historical places, and attending open air activities people also want to see museums of the city they visited. Because museums offer so many interesting and different things differ from other places in the visiting city.  \nFirst of all, people visit museums to learn history of the visiting city. We know that museums generally established to expose special and unique belongings which are historically valuable as well as to expose modern belongings. These old things in the museum give us unique information about the history of the city and its social life. For example, when you go to Metropolitan museum of art in New York city, you can see lots of historical monuments and items belong to American history and also other countries’ history. Observing these items you can get idea about the old times of the visiting place.\nSecondly, museums are places from where you can learn culture of the visiting city. Many items in museums has cultural value beside historical value. For instance art museums  include art collections such as paintings from many different artists. Some of them were made in modern style and some of them in classic. You can get idea the culture of the city from these paintings.\nThird advantage of visiting a museum is that you can have fun visiting a museum. Beside historic and cultural characters, some museums also can be source of fun including attractive activities. If you bored to see classic museums you can go to thematic museums such as natural history museum. There you can see dinasours from old ages. It can be amazing to see different sprecies of animals which are no more live.\nIn sum, museums are attractive places for tourist to discover about the city they visited. By visiting museums we can learn interseting details about the history and culture of that society. In addition to having lots of information we also can have fun to see interesting things in the museums such as huge dinasours. You may feel incomplete if you do not visit the museum of the new place you travel.  \n",

They say it is caused by burning oil, so the society demands itself to enclose it.\nIt is often necessary to have a car when living in a small city or village without public transport, and it is understandable. But while living in a big city, where there are lots of bus stops, tram stops or metro stations is quite incomprehensible that people want to drive their own car and be stuck at a block while rush hours. As the ecology organisations says, it is better for the environment, and as we decided, it is better for us to save our precious time.\nIncreasingly people prefer to use public transport rather than to drive a car for these reasons.\nIt is not true that public transport has no future. The bigger the city is, the more important public transport is. And now, when cities are widening, public transport will be more important than ever.",

  "text": "The importance of internet on our lives\nThe last decades there has been an massive change been in our lives, this is caused by the development of internet. This had been some positive and negative effects on the possibilities to study and on the social life. In this essay I will describe some of those effects. \nIn these days a lot of student are using the internet as a study tool. The internet allows you to search for information in massive online libraries for research and writing essays. There are massive online libraries like Science Direct or Google Scholar to find publications of researchers around the world. The internet is getting important for our study because of the availability of  information sources. \nThe greatest impact of internet on our lives is the use of social media. Almost everybody have at this moment at least one account on a social media like Facebook or LinkedIn. The positive effect is that it is possible to be in contact with your friends and family whenever wherever. One of the downsides you are not able to get away from your bully. This could drive someone crazy and very miserable. The greatest impact of internet on our life is the use of social media because you can get in contact with everybody around the clock.\nThe internet has a lot of consequences on our lives. It makes it possible to study and do research easier. Also it gives the possibility to get in contact with family and friends. There are also negative effects like bullying! I think we should use internet carefully and keep use it with cautious. \n",

It is the football. when i was born i saw my father watching every day football's programmes but i didn't understand what it was. However, overtime i begun to understand how to play and i liked it much more than the past. In fact when i was sixteen years old i begun to go to the stadium with my friends every sunday. In italy, football is the most followed sports,specially in my town where played the most important player of the world: Diego Armando Maradona. He played for my town's club: Napoli. He wins two national championships and also an important european competition. Every day in my town people speak only about football becouse it could give you a lot of emotions.\nA football match is something special and you don t see the time that arrive sunday to watch your favourite club s match. On the other hand, my advice that i give to someone who start this kind of sport is that he must do it with a lot of responsability and sacrifice if he wants to become another Maradona.   ",

I play this game four times a week in a really beautiful centre which is called 'Rai'. There are around ten tennis courts, one swimming pool, two football pitches and three gyms. \nIn my opinion tennis is the best sport because I'm an individualist, so I prefer individually sport, because in these kind of game everything depends from you. In others sports no. For example during a foorball match if you wrong isn't too important because you have a team which can remedy, evin if ypu do nothing. An other reason for loving this sport is that having a racket in hands, for me, is beautiful.\nIf you want start playing this sport remember that when you are playing every points are important and you mustn't relax during the match, even if you are winning with a very big advantage because in a few minutes you could lose the match.\nI hope this sport will have more importance in Italy in the future.\n",

I look forward to understanding and I hope we will reach a consensus.\n\nFirst of all, it is very important to me to determine the basic problem of our school. For many years we, pupils, have been waiting for library. Yet, it has still not been built. Together with an unofficial Student council create a petition which is to raise the issue among teaching council. Our priority is good preparation for secondary school certificate. For this purpose we need a quiet place to learn. Moreover pupils demand is the possibility to borrow books. It is the most important matter, because most of us is not able to buy highly educational books. They are simply too expensive. Our request boils down to the fundamental role of education. It is broadening the horizons of our knowledge.\nBesides issues that have been already mentioned there is also undisputed fact that if our school had a rich computerized library, it would be more representative.\n\nGiven the rationality of the above arguments, we, pupils, expect a positive consideration to our request. \n\nRespectfully yours,\nPiotr Dudek.",

This is a difficult question to be answered too quickly because we have to take into account that we have not enough knowledge at all to do it. That's why we have to describe some important ideas related to this topic.\nFirst of all, as we said before the people's lives have changed due two important elements which are the technological improvements and society changes. The first one it is very obvious because every day the researchers are discovering new things and improving the scientific knowledge that allows us to create new invents and improve the old ones. For example, one of the most important devices that has taken an important role in our lives is the mobile phone which has changed extremely fast over the last ten years. Another example is the cars which are taking the same way as well as the mobile phone has done.\nThe second one is very important too because society has changed a lot as well as the people's mind. For instance, one hundred years ago was impossible to see a woman working and carrying on economically the whole family alone or studying a degree in the university, things that today are very usual and well accepted in our society.\nIn addition, there are other conditions and facts that has helped to change the people's lives such as political decisions, global wars and global economical problems, etc.\nTo sum up, there are many issues that affects people's lives and we do not know how it would change in the future, but we are sure that in 50 years from now it would be an important change as well as it happened these last 50 years ago.",

This sport consist of beating the rival by scoring as many goals as possible. In order to score you should push a small white plastic ball inside the goal using a stick.\n\nIn my opinion grass hockey is the best sport you can play as it requieres you to be really focused on to hit the ball correctly.

Fossil resources are about to run out. We have to therefore choose the other alternatives. For the sake of that the public transport will be improved, instead of being replaced by cars. On the other hand, more electric cars are produced every year. This technology will be improved furthermore in the future. This fact could keep the share of cars.

Besides that, if I had to choose a type of film I would say , the comedian and the action ones are the most appealing to me if they have a real dramatic and coherent story instead of a fictitious and meaningless one.\nRecently I saw some pretty good films called \" The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \" Capitan Philips\" , films that caught my attention since the first minute. Honestly , they lasted for 3 hours but the most impressive of all this is that they were able to create a single world between me and the screen for all that time. \nThey really caught my attention , they had all the characteristics that I consider the basic ones in a film, not couting with the astonishing actors that made an impressive performance. \nAll I expect in a film is the way they establish connections between the actors and the audience , in a way that allows them to play with the characters like if they were puppets and to create a coherent and attractive film.",

Although, herbal medicines have significantly performed well in the treatment and management of illness, people have increasingly consumed these products via self-directed therapy.

It is a movie that has presents a lot of richness in characters and historical facts. You are able to analyse human emotions and rationalise moral situations, so it is a movie that provides a lot of factors.\n\nI found it very exciting because it shows a pre-revolutionary era when Jean Valjean is sent to work as a slave for stealing a small piece of bread. After he ends his sentence, he has to solve many moral situations that prove who he really is. It is very profound too, because it shows you problems that could happen but in a minor scale. What really makes the difference is if you choose to help others or not.\n\nI think people who read the book (written by Victor Hugo), who are interested in this historical incident, or who merely want to analyse human relationships must see the movie. This is due to the fact that it will teach a lot about the French daily life and about what inspires people to improve and cause good.",

Endangered animals will be harder to be found after the destruction of their homelands. Also, there will be no fresh grass and grains for domestic animals, such as cows, lamps, chichen to be fed. \n\nTo reduce above problems, it is necessary for governments to plan carefully before construction of builings and transport and try their best to decrese the side effects.

  "text": "Whenever I hear about famous actor or singer complaining on photographers following them, I can´t get a smile off my face. What's a description of a famous person? Most of the people know a lot about him. So don't tell me that famous people don't enjoy being on the first page of the newspaper or any other magazine. In my opinion the fame is a need for actors and musicians of the popular culture. Despite the fact I said that famous people need to be well known, I think that can't be applied on politicians. The personal space in their life should be larger than in a movie stars, but they should make their descisions transparent for most of the population tho. It is their work to make descisions that ensure the benefit of the people in their country, but we don't need to know nothing else about them, after they come home to spend some time with their families.",

  "text": "Dear Marco,\n\nI am sorry to hear that you’ve got to give up either sport or music.\nI know how much you like both activities so just I suppose you are having a hard time. \nSoccer has always been part of your life and memories of you kid kicking a ball bigger than you are still vivid in my mind. I still remember the first day we went to attend a soccer lesson you promised me you never give up!. You dreamt of becoming a professional player and decided what your life would be like once you reached it. You’ve kept working on it for almost your entire life now and although you have not become a professional one you have never given up. \nHowever, piano is also part of your life. When I first introduced you to it you were quite sceptical of your possible achievements. But again you never gave up and now you playing in the 3rd Orchestra in Town shows how big you are. Proof that not only you are very determined but that piano was meant to be. We have enjoyed music together for nearly 20 years and most of our good times are related to that. \nAs you asked my take what I tried to do was nothing but thinking of you as if you were my son. I imagined the scenario with Mathew coming up to me and looking for some advice. \nFirst off, I would take him to a long journey by car. I’d suggest we take some days off together and head for any particular place he would like to go to. Then once we get on the car I’d let the  music we had planned before as the ideal background absorb us before uttering any words.\nOnly after driving for a while I would ask him to tell me what he’s been up to lately and if there’s anything he hasn’t told me about but keen to mention now.  At that point I would let his talking go without stopping him from interruption. I’m convinced he’ll speak his thought at once without beating around the bush and all his fear and doubt will slip out. By now he will be able to answer himself many questions he’s been troubling with.\nAll I’ll have to do is just point out what the main points are that he is too dull to see. Because that’s what an outside criterion is needed for. Someone else can just help you think out and be nothing but supportive. \nThen he’ll be lost for words as much as he spoke and he will be willing to put the whole thing aside and just lose himself in some drinks, although he hasn’t come to age yet for that. Perhaps the next day he won’t even be able to recall what the speaking was about but I’m pretty sure that after all deep down himself he will know what best move on is to make!!\n",

  "text": "Driving my own car seems really convenient for travelling, but public transportation is the most effective way to bring people from a place to another. Try to imagine that, if everyone in the city has his or her own vehicle, we would be always late due to the terrible traffic jam. In fact, travelling by car is not convenient when people have their own cars for their family or themselves. The reason is that we have to wake up in the very early morning for avoiding the traffic jam to attending school, working, etc. \nThe main advantage of public transportation is that it can transport a large number of passengers at a relatively low cost. For example, a bus can take more than 40 passengers one time at a low cost. For another, the subway is able to transport a number of people around the city. \nThe second benefit of public transportation is that it can reduce the air pollution for a city. Too many vehicles in a crowned city would increase the carbon emissions. \nIn conclusion, public transportation would still pay an important role of transportation in a city unless the environmental vehicles are promoted by the government and the roads and highways in a city are managed well for accommodating a huge number of cars.\n",

  "text": "It’s really important that we do things we should do. So, we can obtain certain benefits and more doors that can be opened easily. There are some people that spend too much of their time doing nothing useful although others may say that it helps to be more relaxed in their lives. Personally, people must dedicate most part of their time on things they should do for two important reasons.\n \nFirst, you gain time doing essential things. By doing so, you immediately take advantage of the time in your life doing something essential. For example, when I was 17, I was about starting my first day of class in the university. I started to feel  bored with complementary courses on my curriculum because there were the kind of courses that didn’t have any help to my university career which is mainly about System Engineering, and I was required to take complementary courses such as Ecology, Laws, and so on. But later when I graduated, I realized how important were those subjects. I was able to explain something basic about Ecology that my grandfather had trouble with in the countryside when I went for a vacation. That experience taught me how important it is doing whatever you are required to do—such as taking complementary courses—without rejecting it, because somehow it’ll be helpful later in the life.\n \nSecond, if you avoid doing things only because those don’t like you, you’ll miss opportunities. You’ll dedicate your time only on things for personal enjoyment and it really will hurt you. For instance, a friend of mine called Freddy was in a social club in the city, he was requested to do a running around the pool for 30 minutes. He refused to do this. After all, one guy decided to do the venture. He ran for 30 minutes around the pool and when he finished, my friend started laughing at him. Nobody had noticed that the president of the social club has an award for the runner, and he received an amount of 30,000 dollars because of his effort. As you can see, my friend lost the opportunity because he didn’t like what he was requested to do.\n \nTo sum up, it is a good decision if you do things that are necessary or needed at the moment though you don’t like it. If you do essential things you gain time in your life at the same time. If you would rather avoid essential or required things you’ll lose many chances to succeed. So, we should focus our minds making the right decision and spend our time wisely doing what is most important. ",

For example, how one person can be informed what happens to the other side of the world with only a click.\n\nFor other part, other people only use the computer to have communication with someone, have entertainment with some movies, which can be from anywhere, or simply have some fun online with your friends that live abroad or are busy all the time.\n\nIn contrast, some people think that the computer is just one more invention in the history of humanity, and although they accept that is an important invention and changes the world, they prefer to say that exist inventions more important than the computer that nowadays we still use. For example the paper or the wheel.\n\nOverall, people are divided in what they think about the most important invention in the world and what changes these objects make to the world and humanity, I still think that the computer is the most important invention because it not only changes one part of the history like the parper or the wheel, it changes every aspect of the human's life.",

Most of the time I like to watch comedies, love stories and adventure movies because these types of films can help me relax after a hard working day. I don't like horrors because they always have a bad impact on my mood. Therefore I feel more peaceful when I view something funny, adventurous and undemanding.\nIn my opinion, people watch movies because they want to spend their leisure time. Movie companies offer all kinds of movies so everybody can choose something that he likes.\nI think other media will fulfil these functions as well. For example, books also help us relax. Besides, we can learn something knew from books. ",

For example, for doing diving, are you provided of all the diving gear (oxygen bottles, wetsuits, security elements, etc.)? That is something really important for us. As you said, the safety of the students is our maximum concern, we must be completely sure that you will take care of them, chiefly because most of the students are still young and we have a strong commitment to their parents.\n\nYours truly, \n\nJennifer Barraza",

  "text": "In my opinion, this statement could be said for a person who lives in a city with little traffic or a person who prefers travel in a freedom way instead of being concerned about public transport schedules. However, I don’t think that this affirmation would be correct for a person who lives in a big city, what is more if you take in a count the economic aspects. \nThe most common problem in crowded cities is that usually they have a lot of traffic jams, and this is because there are too many cars. Since my view, to use the public transport in this case have two important advantages: the first one you don’t have to care about parking; the second one you can move in a relaxed way reading a book, listening to music or talking with other passengers. Nevertheless, having a car in a big city is quite expensive nowadays, not only because the petrol price is continuously raising but also you have to pay high taxes for the car. \nIn short, although travelling by car is more comfortable and easier than do it by public transport, it is not probably than in the near future they disappear.\n",

I think I have some experience with young children as I have to take care of my own brothers every day.\n           In addition to this I go to the gym three times a fortnight and I took swimming lessons for 3 years. Also I had also taken some self-defense lessons and a climbing course over the Alps. I think that I deserve to have a job here because with my swimming and climbing knowledge I can entertain the children. And in order to help them defend themselves I can also teach them some techniques about self-defense.\n            Anyway I hope I will get the job and I am able to attend an interview at half past nine on Saturday.\n                                                                                                                                             Yours sincerely\n                                                                                                                                                   Andrei\n",

  "text": "Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Lula, is a myth. As the only Brazilian president from unprivileged background, Lula has made history after running for four times for President. Since he took up the office in 2002 Lula has made major structural changes in Brazil, taking out more than fourty million Brazilians out of extreme poverty. During Lula's era, from 2002 to 2010, Brazil experienced an economic boom as never before and became a world's economic power. Democracy also had fundamental changes on that period. To curb corruption new laws were created, instituions were re-structured and innovative mechanisms were developed to engage and give voice to the civil society.  Minority groups received more attention to protect their rights and investments in education, health and well being increased. Curiously, Lula is the only Brazilian president without a university degree. For the poorest Brazilians Lula and his history is to be proud of. For the Brazilian elite it is unacceptable that Lula, a poor migrant from northern Brazil, overshadowed all the presidents and most politicians of their own, priviliged, university educated and careless about the real Brazilian problems. \n",

You only can go to your car, sit in and drive away. All what you need is a driving licence, a car and a little bit luck that there is no traffic.\nIf you go with a train, you need a ticket, that's not very cheap! You must know the timetables and at which gate the train will leave. You have to be fast, if you want a seat to sit, sometimes the trains are full of people and you have to stand the whole way!\n\nI think it's right, that travelling by car will be more popular.

In 1995, there were green areas, however they were cut down and an airport and an apartment block were built in those areas. \n\nAnother interesting redevelopment is that factory was knocked down to make way for a shopping centre, and in the same way was for Church which was pulled down to take place for a pub. The urban areas were demolished, to make way for skyscrapers. A final notable change is that football stadium was erected in the south of the city in 2010. ",

  "text": "The President of the United States of America Mackinley says that, regarding Cuba, he will not meddle until December. The newspaper “Times” publishes an intercepted letter written by the Spanish Ambassador Dupuy de Lowe that will make him resign due to what he wrote about the USA. Next to the blow-up of the North American steamer Maine, the Spanish commission created to investigate this explosion assures that it couldn’t be done from the outside, but from the inside. On the other hand, the USA commission brings their results to the Parliament without previously notify their results to Spain and with the opposite conclusion of the Spanish commission. However, the Spanish government does not agree with the USA's conclusions and they request North Americans to solve this disagreement with an international arbitrage. Later, the USA government affirms they do not want to conquer Cuba, but they demand Spain to sign an armistice with Cubans. Mackinley ask for the arbitration of the Pope León XII in the conflict and Spain reclaims North Americans to get out of Cuban beaches in order to show their desire to put an end to the conflict. The Pope requests the Spanish army to cease immediately the hostilities in Cuba. Later, the United States House of Representatives approves a resolution to military intervene in Cuba if necessary. The Spanish Ministry of State publishes a Memorandum relating all the events and conflicts made by the USA to Cuba until the publishing date. In this Memorandum, the main events narrated are the filibustery crimes originated in New York and the change of attitude towards Cuba of the USA after the election of the president Mackinley. Also, this Memorandum specifies the origin of the conflict, which resides in the letter written by Lowe and the blow-up of the steamer Maine, the latter being remarked concerning the USA rejected the Spanish proposition to carry out the arbitrage together. The 21st of April EEUU denies the Spanish sovereignty over Cuba, the 23rd of April Spain sends the Memorandum to several nations and the 25th USA declares the war to Spain. Since that day, the diplomatic relations between both nations will be suspended. ",

If you can keep promises to your friends, that mean how much you really care about them.\nI know how important of keeping promises. I always try to keep them. But the problem is I do really care about my friends, so I always say “Yes” to my friends, because I don’t want to disappoint them. And then I always have a lot of promises to keep, and it also makes me too busy to keep them. \nSo keeping a promise is good, but the thing is :Don’t keep too many promises at the same time! You should consider if you really can complete it or not. That way you won’t have lots of pressure , and you can be an honourable person.\n",

  "text": "There are widely different views on the public transport future. Despite some people would suggest that such service has no future because people are more rely on car as it is convenient, it is my personal belief that public transport should continue and has its future. Two of the principle reasons for this are as follows. \n\nFirstly, the society today are more concerned about environmentally friendly. This is a worth seeing be concerned because air pollution has negative impact on our health and the ecosystems. The more cars on the road, the more green house gases produced. Therefore, public transport play an important role to mitigate global warming. For example, if a bus can carry 100 passengers, at least 25 cars can be reduced on road, solved the problem of traffic jam. In addition, scientists and engineers are working hard to invent and improve the vehicles, so they become less harmful to the environment. \n\nThe second argument is more related to everyone and has great influence. For those who do not drive, public transport is extremely important. There are thousands  of students travel with public transport to school everyday because they cannot drive and their parents do not have time to drive them. Moreover, insurance, petrol, repair fees are very expensive. Not everyone can afford it. On the other hand, public transport is good value of money. \n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport should have future. Professionals are continuing to develop a better vehicle to make it eco-friendly, and there are still many people rely on public transport.",

This is the only way to maintain mental health and not to fall into depression.\nWe can say for sure that stars and celebrities are also people. It means that in everyday life they are faced with the same problems as we do. What is more, celebrities as ordinary people need some time to rest and some time to build deep relationship with others. As ordinary people they need someone to take care of them, someone to share their feelings with. It does not matter what amount of money is in their accounts. They are not able to buy real relationships such as friendship and love. They can gain fame and admiration thanks to their skills but their stage personality is more like a powerful creation. Sometimes in everyday life they are not even interesting in terms of character and appearance.\nWe all go through hardships and failures.

  "text": "  Learning new languages is becoming a priority for young people because most of them go to study abroad and work with foreign countries. \n I believe that knowing more languages is always better. that way people have a lot more culture and are more knowledgeable. Those are the people who know their way around life. Another great reason for knowing languages is that people will like and respect you. You will also develop your mind and learn new things. So knowing a lot of languages could be very useful in life.\n On the other hand, learning languages is not always practical. It takes  a lot of time to know any language fluently and it waists time. Even if you learn a certain language and you don’t use it manually, you will simply forget it. It turns out that learning a foreign language may be pointless.\n In conclusion learning languages may be very handy but can also be a killing time activity. So it’s nice to know other languages, but just those you will really need.",

Next to him were few dozens of doors and there were letters written on it. The man spoke, \" Welcome\". He led me to a room which said 'Happy' at the door. When Michael stepped into the room, I felt something very fresh inside me. It was like breathing in a forest. I felt happy. Really Happy. The old man said, \"You feel happy, Don't you?\" Michael nodded. He went on, \"Every room have a feeling written on it. That feeling tells you what you will feel inside the room.\". Michael went into couple of rooms until I spotted a room written 'Anger'. He was curios about how he will feel when he goes into the room. He stepped into the room.

I also think that the following famous people sometimes could be dangerous. For example, when fan follow the cab, she or he could be hurt, because the traffic is really unpredicable or when there is a huge mass of fans, they could hurt each other. \nMy opinion is, that the famous people deserve a quiet time, when they are with their partners or with family, but also when they are just going to the supermarket or gym. Yesterday I saw in the magazine photo of Sarah Jessica Parker on which she was walking with her dog. The headline was: LOOK AT THE SARAH WITHOUT MAKE-UP, SHE LOOKS LIKE A HORSE! My first though was: \"God, let her live her life! She is only a human being!\" \nWhy when men stalk a women they forbid him to come closer to her, but when a papparazi hide in car of celebrity, he will get a huge pack of bucks for the photos?",

  "text": "I'm going to talk about social networks. Years ago, we used to get through with other people ringing up or texting messages by our mobile phone and as time goes by, nowadays we also can communicate by social networks such as twitter, facebook, whatsapp... First of all, we use them to catch up on news, social issues by twitter instead of newspapers, for instance, it's usually to see people having breakfast in a cafeteria readings news by his smartphone, an image so far from years back. We also can have more knowledge about current issues by Facebook pages which are not considered appropriate by some TV programmes such as political discussions, strikes, economy... As far I concerned, nowadays population know more about what's going on in the world than in previous years. One example of this could be North Corea or some Arab countries where their Government ban to have access Internet to citizens, in other words, they want to mislead about reality avoiding population could claim bu this nets or up in arms against their system. On the other hand, we can get more information about our known and unknown people who are our friends by facebook, uploading photos at any time, taking a coffee, watching a football match or spending summertime somewhere. So, this means we are getting less intimity and becoming more gossiping at the same time, as a consequence of sharing our lives on public sites. You can follow to your favourite celebrities and have a direct interaction but this also has negative consequences such as some followers critise to them",

It was a new thing for her knowing that someone had the guts to sit next to her because almost all the people on that school define her as a weirdoe. \n'Excuse me?'\nShe looked up and she was surprised seeing the stranger beside her is the famous Michael.

'Uh yeah. I know you' she said. Michael thought it would just be easy talking to this girl. Seeing her that close makes him realised that she's not ugly. The word beautiful is not enough to describe her. She's gorgeous, if she would only take off her glasses maybe other people will notice it too. 'Nice then, do you mind going out with me on a date?' he blurted. 'No' she replied. This guy actually ask her out and she's not that stupid not to know his intentions. She stood up, packed her things and went out of the library. \nMichael was surprised. He had never expected that he would receive a no from this kind of girl that is even far from his type. She just challenged him.\nThe past two weeks of Celine's life changed in just a blink of eye. Michael didn't give up on asking her out. Rumors spread that easily. She knew herself that Michael is just playing with her and she said to herself that she will never fall into his trap. If he wants to play, then she will give him the best game he could and would ever have. She's going out with him.\n\nTwo months had passed since the day they dated. Since then, everything went so perfect between the two of them. Celine realised that Michael is not that bad and maybe those rumors she heard before were only rumors and they only wanted to destroy Michael's reputation. She baked a cake for him because she wanted to thank him for the flowers she received yesterday. One of the things she knew about him is that Michael loves to surprise, that's why she wants to surprised him too. She's on her way to the court where Michael was practing when she heard guys talking.\n'Do you still plan on finishing our bet or the rumor is true Michael? You have fallen to Miss Jane?' it was Nicolaih Heindric voice. 'I'll do it. Just be patient. I can't wait to have that car of yours' Michael said. Celine knew at that moment that her world had fallen down. Tears automatically falls down her face. Everything Michael did for her was just for a bet.\n\nThe next day while Michael is on his pad watching tv, he heard his door bell rang, he was surprised to receive someone now. The last time he remember he never invited anyone. He would like to invite Celine but he knew she would decline to him again and he's not ready to be alone with her. Maybe he's too coward to admit it but yes, he's inlove with Celine. He tried to deny it to his friends because he knew the moment he told them the truth Celine's life would change. He knew how Celine loves having her privacy, he knew the moment he admit to everyone that he loves her, she would never have her normal life anymore. He just loves that girl that he would protect her from everything. Even if it cost him hiding how much he loves her. When he open the door he was more surprised to see who's on the door. His eyes looked automatically on how Celine looked today. Is it only him or she was wearing a sexy dress? He opened the door wider and let her in with a big smile on his face. Celine came in and kissed him aggressively. The next thing Michael knew is that he is making love with this girl. Everything felt amazing and beautiful. All they could hear was them kissing. 'I love you so much' Michael blurted after what they did then hug her. He felt a liquid falling on his shoulders. Is it raining? he asked himself. He realised that it wasn't raining. Those were Celine's tears. 'I knew everything. Everything was just a bet right?' Celine said. Michael got frozen. 'Everything that happened to us was too good to be true. I shouldn't have believed you. I shouldn't have believe that you will change just for me. I'm just so stupid to believe guys like you. Now you have what you wanted.' Celine said with a broken voice and a broken heart. 'Look away. I'm going to dress now' Celine added. Michael can't believe of what he had just heard. The next thing he knew is that she was gone not only on his pad but from his life. He just lost the girl he loved for the first time. Micheal decided to get dress, he was on the way to the door when he saw a box of things he gave to Celine. Tears started to fall from his eyes. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.",

For some of us trade is a thing for a living, but other people treat shopping like a good thing to spend time and they are enjoying it very much. For me, shopping is not enjoyable and I am trying to avoid big shopping centres.\nThe very first reason for my disagreement is that I do not have enough money to purchase everything which I would like to buy. Things are getting more and more expensive and I am really disappointed when I must go out of the shop with nothing and furthermore it gives me a big amount of sadness. \nThe next thing about unpleasant shopping are enormous lines. Going for a few food-stuffs always end with an hour in a line. No matter in what time you come to shop, you will wait.\nThe last, but not least reason against enjoyable shopping is that I have to travel a lot to a store in which I can buy everything I want. Of course I might go to a few different shops, but without driving license travelling is tough task. Carrying many heavy bags is not my favourite kind of spending my spare-time.\n",

Beautiful and important places for the history of this amazing tropical country.\nAmong all of them, one of the places you must visit in Brazil is the Amazon Theater, located in Manaus, the town of Amazon State, in the north of the country.\nThe building is important because it was built in the last century during the rubber age, when the city was one of the most richest city in the world.\nArchitects, builders, painters and sculptors were brought from Europe by ship as well as all the material construction that were necessary for its building. It is a sophisticated construction, full of details, everywhere around the theater, from the floor to the ceiling, everything carefully fashioned according to that period. Even if it has more then 100 years since it was built, all the original fashion are still there, intact, with all the luxury ready for everyone's visit.\nThe place set out important concerts, presentations and international festivals until nowadays.\nThe theater is famous not just because of its age, but also because it was built in the middle of the jungle. During the rubber age there was no urban life around the build, which is completely different from today of course since there is a restored square and a church in front of the theater, that have the same age of the theater and is surrounded by art galleries, pubs, offices, houses, restaurants, where groups of friends, tourists and families are used to go to appreciate the breeze in the end of a warm day and during the night.\nIt really worth visiting Amazon Theater in Manaus, taking pictures and having good stories to tell in your life.\n",

  "text": "In the reading passage, the writer provides several theories about the purpose of the carved stone balls. However, the lecturer points out the problems in all his assertions. \n\nFirstly, the author holds that the stone balls were possibly used in hunting or fighting. In contrast, the professor argues that they were impossibly weapons because they show no damage. If they were used as weapons, they should be broken up or divided into pieces. \n\nSecondly, the writer claims that the stone balls might be us as standard weights to measure. Nevertheless, the lecturer contends that the theory is indefensible. The main reason is that the craved stone balls are different types of stones. It is because different stones have different densities that their weights are different though they are uniform in the same size. \n\nLast but not least importantly, the author asserts that the stone balls might serve a social purpose. The professor, however, doesn't think so because the the designs of the stone balls are too simple to show the important social status. Moreover, in general, artifact of social symbol is buried with its owner after he or she died. However, the craved stone balls were not found near any graves. \n\nTo sum up, the professor totally disagree with the statement in the reading passage. ",

People can go wherever they want and whenever they want without thinking of buying a ticket or getting to a station  on time to catch a bus or a train. Car gives comfort  because you can personalise your space and your ride. All the same car is also necessity today, because very often that is the only means to get to where you need to.\n\nHowever, public transport is not threatened by car. First of all, too many cars make towns crowded and  create traffic jam, which is counterproductive. Secondly, one car is making as much pollution as one bus which transports many more people. \n\nIn my opinion, public transport is secured in the future.  It will even get more popular because it will be faster, modern, and cheaper than a travellng by car.",

We were thinking that meeting there we will have a funny night in friends, but we were very wrong.\nWhen we arrived we saw an old house where Michael lived. He was waiting for us outside. At first, we didn't think that something bad was going to happen. When we got inside his house, we saw a lot of old pics on his wall, it was like a horror movie!  Michael looked very nervous too. \nAfter a while, when we were playing one of his Computer game, we heard a scream coming from his garden. There were two bodies in that place. They were Michael's parents, his father was dead, but his mum no.\nThen, Michael tried to hide their bodies in a room, without knowing that his mum was alive.  When we saw that we escaped as fast as we could, and we saw as his mum walking to find Michael, like a zombie.\nIn the end, We heard Michael's scream. We never see him again, I think that when Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake. \n",

That's a novel written by Sidney Sheldon called ''If tomorrow comes''. There is also a film based on the book.\nIt talks about an ordinary young woman who has everything she needs in life. After she finds out that her mother has committed a suicide because of some kind of fraud she decides to revenge her but she gets into a prison. After she comes out she decides to make another revenge because of the same reason.\nThis book is very exciting because there is a lot of things that are happening and it's not monotonous at all. It has a lot of intrigues and a lot of to think about what's going to happen next.\nI would recommend this book to the people of all ages because it has something for everyone. It is serious enough for the older ones and it has a romantic side for the younger ones. It is a really good book that shouldn't bee missed.",

  "text": "Everything happened that summer I spent in Egypt. My mother had found a new job in some ancient ruins, right in the middle of the desert. I should mention that she was an important archaeologist, known all over the world, and she had to travel to every corner on Earth. I used to spend my whole holidays at my grandparents’ country house, surrounded by green fields, forest and rivers, but when I turned eighteen my mother thought I was old enough to take a plane on my own and stay with her for a month.\nI didn’t expect to find anything else than sand, heat and tourists on my way across the desert, even though I was leading myself to a patch of water among leagues of wasteland, the oasis of Faiyum. Finally, my plane landed in Cairo almost five hours after I had left England and I had to remember that the time there were two hours in advance. When I managed to reach the outside I had a taxi waiting for me, probably sent by my mother, so at least I didn’t have to look for another one in the stifling heat of the city. On the other hand, the taxi didn’t even have air conditioning, so I spent the two hours of the journey trying to fan myself with a magazine I borrowed from the driver. I reached the hotel well in the afternoon, nevertheless, the air was still oppressive and hot like at midday. Even though I had to bear the climate, I was happy with being able to see my mother more often than I used to in past summers. I hadn’t met her since the beginning of last February, and that was five months before then.\n",

  "text": "A group of young people from abroad will be visiting my home town for three months. This is a short report which will include my recommendation about the most interesting places in my town for them to enjoy. \n\nI have chosen two most popular places to have a good time in my town. The first place would be \"Culture Centre\" and the second one \"Sports Centre\". In the \"Culture Centre\" your young visitors will be able to join daily cultural activities, such as theater, cinema and drawing classes, whereas in the \"Sports Centre\" they will have an opportunity to join many sports activities, such as bowling, swimming, athletics and karate classes.\n\nAdditionally, since the young people are going to stay in my town for a few months, I suggest that they should subscribe to a Polish language course. It is very helpful to be communicative in Polish language at least on a basic level. The course would be three times a week only, and fully paid by the Polish government. The course will give your young visitors not only a lot of fun but also a general knowledge about Polish culture and eating habits as well. \n\nIn short, a trip to Poland will be an unforgettable experience for your students. However, they should be aware of high costs of living in my town. ",

In recent years, I have been buying the ham in a shop in Cáceres which is hugely popular and I really enjoy seeing that my family is delighted, but overall I enjoy seeing my niece, who is still a child, eating ham.\n\nEvery year, in my house, we play the same role: my mother and my sister prepare different plates for Christmas dinner, and I am highly probably the responsible for carrying those plates from the kitchen to the dining room, because the rest of the family is lost in their conversations trying to save the world. \n\nIt was while I was coming in and out from the kitchen I found my niece standing on a side of the table eating ham. I don’t know how she took the plate from the centre of the table and put it in front of her, but she had started to eat it, without asking anyone. \n\nIt was an unforgettable moment, I was looking at her slightly excited because she was eating alone without help and fast, which was and still is unusual coming from her.\n",

Unfortunately it's not possible because of the costs that the Economic System would be compelled to support. So people often prefer using the car and paying for oil instead of the bus ticket but having more advantages: not to be constricted to wait for the buses and not to have to take a taxi in the night when they come back from the disco, for example..\nRecently, in many towns, there is also a new system for moving around the city. It's called \"City car\" or \"Car Sharing\" and it consists in sharing a car, using it for our movements and then letting it in every part of the city in the dedicated parking. It's a cheap service and it's very appreciated from people who needs car not every day but only for a little time.\nSo I think that in a short time, cars will take the place of the public transport.",

In the beginning, one of them, looks for a job asking to the boyfriend sister, but fortunately his friend convince him to find another work. One day, finding on google, the two friends discover that google looks for new people to employ in its company. They send their curriculum.

Of course, on paper, this group haven't chances, but the events will demonstrate something of different.\n\nThis film is interested because it drafts work problems but not only for this; it also transmits some important values like, the importance of the solidarity, the group cohesion and the importance not to lose the fait in dreams even if the situation is withstands.\n\nOf course there are also negative observations about this film: for example there are some pornographic scenes in the middle of the story: they aren't interesting and they during so much time. In addition some situations of the film are taken from the high school movie.\n\nIn conclusion this film is plain and a little discounted but in the same time light and funny film to watch during the summer with some friends.\n",

So you can see nearly all Spain in a month and it is quite worth, according to my best friend. The problem is that you have to book the hotels you want to stay so yoou need some time to prepare it. You should bring summer clothes because it's very hot at his time of the year, and some jackets since the north of this country can be a little chilly too.\nAs you know, my father runs a tour agency which needs some new staff and they are looking for people who speak at least three languages.

  "text": "I think that there are different types of famous people. The most are famous because they expose their private life and all their interests are to making money. The rest of celebrities are artists or good workers. They do not think in money or fame, simply they enjoy working.  \nOn the one hand, I agree with the statement because everyone has the right to maintain a private life. It has to be uncomfortable to go out of your house and find some reporters or paparazzi waiting for you to asking or to taking photos. If something changes in your life will be a notice in television, and people will invent rumours about you. Not know if people take interest in you because they are real fans or is a person who wants to take advantage of you.\nOn the other hand, I disagree with the statement because if they are public people, fans will interest in them. There are celebrities that sell their life in television and then do not want to journalists chase them.  There are other famous people who not appear in television and they are chased by reporters. This is the result that something new has occurred  and they want to collect information. It is impossible to take a private life if you are a celebrity, because people who love you want to know about your privacy. \nTo summarize, if you expose yourself to television you will not have a private life. The best way to keep it is not be a famous person.",

On the hand famous people intend to protect their private live, but on the other hand they want to be followed by paparazzi. First of all being on the covers of rags help them  make their more attractive for directors.The other reason is that actors want to be recognisable, because popularity give possibility to earn more money.

  "text": "Garlic is a plant, member of the lily family, with an odor and a taste characteristic. It is known by Human history at least since 3000 B.C. In many cultures, garlic is associated with superstitions, providing bad or good lucky.\nIn Ancient Egypt, garlic was used by people for heath purposes. The slaves, who constructed pyramids, were fed with garlic, because the Egyptians believed that garlic would make the workers stronger, so they could work harder. In Roman and Greek cultures, people believed in  garlic's magic powers to avoid the Evil. Even Homer cited garlic in his odyssey. In Middle Ages, sailors carried garlic with them to endure long periods in the seas. In more recent years, in the World War I, soldiers used garlic to prevent from gangrene. \nAt the present time, modern Science is providing some evidence of a real beneficial effect of garlic consumption in human health. Experiments made with garlic and some types of bacteria, revealed the ability of garlic to kill some kinds of bacteria. At least 23 different types of bacteria were tested. Thereby, the bactericidal effect of the garlic, probably can explain some ancients’ beliefs that this plant can help in some illness treatments. It can explain too, why the use of garlic was a good option to prevent gangrene in WWI. Another experiment demonstrated a positive effect of garlic in blood system. It was demonstrated that garlic has a compound that can make the blood \"thinner\". This can be used to prevent heart attack and stroke. \nTherefore, include garlic in the diet can really be beneficial for health as some cultures believed.\n",

  "text": "How many of us today are really into helping the environment.  There are lot of campaigns going on globally.  Is it worth all the time, energy and money in convincing people to be responsible to their environment? Yes, indeed!\n\nI recently joined a campaign program in Manila, Philippines dedicated to protecting and preserving our natural resources.  I was very enthusiastic in all the activities not until after that one event. I found out that the leaders of this organization are not realizing the beliefs and principles they are imparting to the public.  They are not a good representation of their ideals.  I backed off and  decided to just continue to do my personal contribution in helping mother earth.\n\nI believe that if we aim for a change, then the change should start with us.  Maybe we cannot convince the whole world participate in helping the environment right away, but it can begin with ourselves.  After my awareness of what was happening in our natural resources, I am very glad to have been doing my part.  I am now living an environment-friendly lifestyle since 5 years ago. Firstly, I cycle everyday to work. This just didn't save me from too much gasoline expenses, but it also made me physically fit. Secondly, I turn off the faucet and the switches when not in use.  Thirdly, I segregate my rubbish.  At home I have separate garbage bins for paper, plastic and organic wastes.  Forthly, I am only buying organic products for consumption and keeping a small spice garden at my backyard.  And finally, I am educating my two children about the importance of what I am doing inorder to help our environment.\n\nAll in all, I think that helping our environment doesn't have to be big time. We should be aware of the fact that mother earth is irreplaceable nor irrevocable.  We have the time now to do what is necessary.  We can begin in ourselves, in our family, in our own homes.  That is a small start, but will eventually reap a huge outcome. \n",

So, I've tried to translate your French on Google translator and I've couldn't understand what you mean about my English and Google translator. I'm used to write English and I have an intermediate level. I use Google translator to find an equivalent word to a Spanish word sometimes . It isn't easy at all, they're too different languages, and I prefer to use the software \"Grammarly spellchecker\" to get some help. Anyway if you want to know my level I can tell you I've finished the level B1. I will start the level B2 the next course.\n\nI think you don't know our national team. There is a new and stunning basketball players generation. Mirotic, Ibaka, Claver, Marc Gasol (and his younger brother is all a promise) Therefore we'll have Paul Gasol's brothers at least for ten years more but also, Felipe Reyes, Rudy Fernadez, Sergio Rodriguez, Sergio Llul, Calderón are young still. I'm sorry to tell you, but we are going to have an awesome team for a long time still.\n\nAbout Ricky Rubio:\n\nI think you don't follow the American news. You just have to search on Youtube and you'll find a lot of videos. He's improving his game in a spectacular way. Indeed, his team was almost at the end of the NBA teams whilst they are in the middle position now. It isn't only that he's a very good player (He is :D ) but also, thanks to his style of play, his assists, and points has served as a lever to his team that has improved dramatically. He began to play as a professional in Spain when he was 14 years old and he began in our national team when he was 17 years old. His current team is preparing him physically in the gym, his physical form has improved a lot and now is faster, stronger and he's still 23 years old. Watching him play is a delight, especially his assists and juggling games while he looks at the opposite direction. I really enjoy watching him to play a lot.",

  "text": "Hello.\nI am going to talk about my country. I live in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm. A big city with more than one million people. I live in a little part of stockholm called Danderyd. Danderyd isn't inside the city. It's some kilometers outside of it. Because Danderyd isn't in the city it's very much nature and nice people. \nSo Sweden is located in the north part of Europe. Between Norway and Finland. It's a big country and doesn't have many inhibitants. Around 9-10 million people. It's one of the biggest countries in Europe if you think about the area Sweden have. Anyway, about one thousand years ago Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway was Vikings. The Vikings where like pirates that lived in the countries I was talking about one thousand years ago. They sailed to France and England to plunder. But they also where the ones that first discovered Greenland, North America and Asia. The Vikings where feared from most people in Europe but they where also merchants and explorers. \nThe most people in Sweden are christians. But because Sweden accept so many people to flee to Sweden from the wars in the northern parts of Africa and the southwest parts of Asia. \nThe nature in Sweden can be very cold, especially in the northern parts of Sweden. If you are at the most northern part of Sweden it's always day in the summer and always night in the winter. Also when it's winter you can see something called the northern light. It's a strange light in the sky in different colours that is very beautiful. Some just travel to Sweden just to see it. \nIn Sweden we have very good education. Most people go to highschool and unversity. There are though a problem with jobs. It's hard for young people to find jobs in Sweden.\nIn Sweden we are very proud of a free download able program where you can listen to almost all the music in the world. It's called Spotify and have grown super big. There is also another free program that is called Skype where you can talk to eachother and text eachother totally free!\nThe gaming community in the world is growing fast and most of the boys that have a computer play games. In Sweden gaming is really big and there is also one game maker that have made a game called BF or Battle Field. It have been a great succes and is one of the best games in the world. \nWe in Sweden are also very proud of our best football player, Zlatan. He's one of the best football players in the world and is really popular both in Sweden and in other countries, especially in Europe. \nEven though we have a lot to be proud of we need to make a lot of things better. In Sweden we have a lot of different people from different kultures. The problem is that there are a lot of swedish people that are razists. Not the majority of course but there are many razists. That can be really painfull for those who isn't from Sweden from the beginning. Or for those who doesn't have swedish culture. \nAlso as I said before we need more jobs.\n",

  "text": "His name is Mohamed but he is normally called Franco, an easier name to use in Italy, the Country where he is working. Mohamed is from Senegal, 33 years old, graduated in education with a master in education for children and people with special needs. He completed his studies six years ago but since then he was unable to find a proper employment in his Country. Therefore, he decided to migrate looking for better job opportunities. After a complex and difficult journey, Mohamed managed to reach the Italian coasts in 2011.Helped by a Senegalese community, he has eventually found a  job as a fruit seller in a local market. Despite his high qualified studies in education, Mohamed had to carry on a job in a completely different field.\nThe phenomenon of immigration of people from Africa to Europe seeking better opportunities has become common in the last  decades. However, nowadays even in the rich Western Europe, many highly qualified European graduates struggle to find an employment. This has become a challenging issue that is leading most of them to start the same immigration pattern followed by Mohamed towards other Countries.\nUnlike the post-War society, where the European economy was booming, since more than 5 years, Europe is suffering from a profound economic crisis whose major effects are borne by the youths, including the highly qualified graduates.\nSuch a phenomenon is also worsened by the education curriculum adopted in many schools, which has failed to adapt to the changes brought in the society by globalization. Schools and job markets are often separated like two different worlds. Therefore, once graduated, qualified youths find themselves to face both the economic crisis and a hostile job market.\nI believe that Governments from different Countries should come together to find appropriate measures to overcome the economic crisis and stop the vicious circle that leads qualified people to be excluded from the job market and, therefore, contribute to worsen the impact of the economic crisis.\n",

I am not a class act yet I try to do my best, so if I have to work in a team I am the mover and shaker of the group. However, as I tend to be set in my ways sometimes I can appear a know-it-all or too pragmatic.\n\nI would like to be part of this project as next year I will have to live at miles of distance from my parents in order to study Medicine. Therefore I think this experience of three months can offer me a unique chance of growing as a person and better understand if I am actually ready to be 100% independent. I think this experience is the challenge that I need in order to become more mature and responsible.\n\nI believe that this project is the smartest way to spend my summer. Indeed following a routine of work would allow me to put my mind in gear and study two or three hours a day. In addition probably this project is the best chance of really getting to know more about the Baltic Republics.\n\nA couple years ago I have spent a couple weeks in Bright with Ef. During this period I have shared a room with two Finnish girls in a foster family. We got on like a house on fire and I still keep several wonderful memories. Therefore I would be more than willing to share this experience with another student.\n\nAs the 6th of September there is going to be the university entry test for Medicine, I will have to flight back to Italy for a couple days.\n\nIn my spare time I am the baby-sitter of an adorable boy who is only 6 years old. Last year I did some graphic designs for the website of a society called SHIPinSPACE. In addition, last year I participated in a stage at the ASL of Rivoli. I am going to repeat the experience in March at the local hospital.",

One of the most widely used is the subway.\n\nStudents often use public transport between cities instead of cars.\nThere are many people who have experienced a carcrash, or just simply afraid of driving, so they prefer to use public transport system.\nThose  people who has mental or other serious illness doesn't allowed or not able to drive a car, for them public transport system is necessary.\nNot to mention that driving a car means you are responsible for your passengers' life and it is less about convenience even if travelling by car means you don't need to adjust to other passengers.\n\nI agree with that there is a lower demand for public transport in smaller cities and towns, but it doesn't mean it has no future.\n",

  "text": "I’m from Ecuador a country surrounded by a great number of natural resources. We are an underdeveloped country, like other countries says a \"third world country\", but I’m happy about that. Why?, because we see develop countries and the form that they use the resources. We see what they really are, the underdeveloped countries that they are. Seeing all of it we will change our future, doing different things that they have done.\nRecently my country is starting to develop their resources, our renewable energy as wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal energy. Nowadays, we really focus on how we can extract this energy, but not in other important things, like the way that we can start to use it, the correct use that we could give them or how we can reuse the energy. Starting to develop our nation, it is eventually starting an excessive use of energy and hence starting to destroy the environment.\nTraditional energies are focus on give to big cities all the resources. Poor people leave their towns to look for a better live, but if we start to give them enough resources and decrease their migration to the big cities, the need of energy would be decreased. Also it is a big opportunity to help them. They need resources to improve their live condition until my country could has the possibility to give them a better live opportunities. It is difficult to understand a sectoral development where the global interest is big cities, without looking and help the surroundings.\nNowadays my country have started to build a great number of hydroelectric, wind parks and we also starting to think on geothermal energy. But I think one thing that it is necessary before implementing this type of energies. All of that require further studies have been done and with that, we could know the feasibility of the projects and the size of them.\nImplementation takes time and money, but if the project does not work all of that could be spent in vain. Sustainability is not about searching for resources and then build large constructions to extract them. Sustainability is about found the better way to interact with the environment. It is like to make friendship with nature and knows that what it needs of us and show what we need of it. Trying to take care of it, extracting only the necessary and trying to cause the least possible damage.\nAs I said before all of it needs time and a great number of studies. Starting to interest in alternative energy and try to see forms to use in your native country is the first step. The implementation of projects not need to be only for spending money. In a good way implementation of projects helps to improve citizens lifes. All those little steps help to our nation to build a developed country, friendly with the environment.\n",

It encourages people to plant more trees and cutting of them have been made a punishable offence. Burning of leaves and other waste products have also been made punishable offences. A large number  of huge capacity waste treatment plants have been established to keep the city clean and green. Recently, for the protection of environment, the Hon'ble National Green Tribunal passed an order banning diesel vehicles of more than 15 years. Gradually, people of the city are getting cautious with respect to the environment and they are trying best of them to keep it clean and safe. People are inculcating the habit to dispose garbage at a defined space. They are conserving  rain water using rain water harvesting process. They are trying to reduce dependency on private vehicles and switching on public transport mode. They are using more renewable sources of energy rather non-renewable sources of energy. Installation of solar heater, solar lights, use solar cell watches and driving electric cars are in vogue in the city.     ",

There are four main characteres the owner's hotel a moody man and his bossy wife, and the workers a pleasant maid and a Spanish waiter who doesn't speak English. In every chapter new clients go to this hotel and have a lot of crazy, funny and sarcastic situations, between workers, owners and customers.

  "text": "    As the technology develops rather rapidly, it's a world-wide phenomenon now for us to find that large-scale buildings and transport networks are to be built for the sake of human's economy, which means vast areas of farmland,forest and wetland are on the way of being ruined. A large number of problems are coming up at present.\n    Fitst of all, the environment that belongs to both man and wild lives is going to lose balance in the ecosystem.It indicates that more kinds of species are endagered for they are unable to adapt themselves to the remaining lands. Then comes the problem of human beings.Vegetables and other food planting on the farmland will decrease so much that the needs of human may not be meet one day.  Moreover,with the decreasing number of trees and many other plants ,carbon dioxide can not be coped with by those natural machines ,which will melt the remaining ice in  the world. Thus,the sea level will go up to influence the climate leading to warmer days in the whole world.\n    As far as I'm concerned, it's critical for governments to take mesures to reduce the problems.Firstly,relevant laws and principles should be put up to forbid extravagent expansion in the natural system. In addition,supervision of the protecting steps need to be undertanken by the government.What's more,the importance of the protection of nature can be emphasized by educating citizens gradually,no matter in campus or in the public places.Anyway,to key to protect our living environment from being destroyed is to do it by we indivisuals step by step.",

  "text": "    When it comes to the issue if Pets can be like our family . Some people suggest that we have to avoid treating them this way ,while the others maintain the opposite view. As far as I am concerned , the later point of view carries more weight. I am inclined to believe that pets can be treated as a family members because they are  loyal , have souls as well as they are human friends.\n      First of all, Dogs and cats are a very loyal creatures. There are many dogs who are loyal and trustworthy than many people in the earth. Pets can not deceive or lie. Many dogs for example help their owners and protect them from many dangers. For illustration , My friend has a dog, one day when they were in his farm. A snake tried to bite my friend but his dog at the last moment saves him and took that snake away. That is why I love pets. He made an action which many other people could not. For that reason I appreciate my pets as if they are one of my friends.\n     Secondly, reason for my propensity of treating pets as a family member, is that they have souls. they feel as if they are humans. They feel our love towards them and they can exchange this love with us. While they can not express their emotions in our ordinary ways. Everyone has to treat them in a kind way. They will never try to hurt any human being so why people try to hurt them. Domestic animals are a very sensitive creatures that we have to treat them as our babies.\n      Another point that is worth mentioning is that pets can be considered as human friends. We can talk , walk and hangout with them. Many people can talk with their pets as if they understand them. One can talk with his dog , cat or any other kind of pets as they are their psychiatrist. They discuss with them many life events. For example, I have an old neighbor who lives alone with his cat. He talks with her and plays with her. When I see him and ask him how do you do. He always told me that we are fine referring to him and his cat. After seeing how this old man lives alone with his cat without suffering from loneliness. I do not mind or fear living alone anymore as I have my friend which is my cat.\n       To sum up, as a person reaches adulthood, he needs to decide weather to be a human or not.

Since they are creatures like us have souls and feelings. They can take care of us and love us in a very interesting way. That is why I consider my cat my faithful friend.\n",

It was my boss, he told me: \"Go ahead!, the project follows!\". I hung up the phone and I go out to celebrate the moment with my colleagues. We felt very happy.\n\nThanks for a crowd funding campaign, we obtained the mininum funds to develop our innovate work. We found a group of algae which store energy cleanly. We only needed a water tank and the Sun.The energy of the Sun was the food for the seaweeds and they stored it in their cells. Unforturnately, the process only gone on twelve hours. Our goal was increasing the storage capacity in several days. We built a pilot plant to test our investigations in the laboratory. The public administration helped us when we showed our solutions. Nowadays, our team have grown up and we are thirty people. We are going to build an industrial plant to achieve our dream: storing renewable energies without using toxic materials and mining commodities from the Earth.\n",

They think that this group of people has just a better life and things are going very well. But people should realized, that there are many advantages and disadvantages of being celebrities. As far as I'm concerned, there are more disadvantages. Basically, famous figure has no privacy. They can't go to the cinema, or theatre, or just go for a walk without being recognised. No matter where famous person goes, he must realized, that next day he will be on first page newspepers with lots of rumours. Celebrities don't have an easy life. I think they have no life at all. Beacuse, what is proper in living when journalist following every step the famous person takes? We all are free people and everone deserve to have his own life. In my opinion journalist and other people should accepted and respected it and sometimes they should just let go. Nevertheless, celebrities decided on that kind of life. They made that decision on their own. So, I think, that they must have known about the consequences and just live as they like.",

The acting was surprisingly emotional, but a bit wooden. After the show I was introdused to one of the actors, who was my friend's cousin. I wandered if he was planning to enter any drama school. His answer astonished me; he did not want to become a professional actor. Moreover, he found being famous extremely irritating.\nI, like most people, took for granted that celebrities not only seek fame, but also benefit from it. They experience gracious living, enjoy glitzy parties and admire their photos in glossy magazines. Anyway, it is only one side - What do we know about the flipside of fame? \nDo we often think what it means to live under constant public scrutiny? Every mistake the famous make is charged against them. They can do nothing that couldn't be gossipped about. They are even not allowed to have anything for their own. Paparazzoes make public their day-to-day routine, hobbies and passions. When it turns out that all who we got used to idolise are just people with their shortcomings, we become disappointed. We watch mercilessly how celebrities topple from their thrones and even find pleasure in that.\nPeople, it doesn't matter if they are famous or not, are just people. Nobody is perfect. Why don't we want to give people entertaning us a chance to be themselves and to have a really private life?\n",

It's one of the best tv cooking programme that I have ever seen and I absolutely agree with you when you say that this programme promotes the individual and collective work.\n\nI have a friend who went to MASTERCHEF and he taught to the amateur cooks how to make bread. He is a famous artisan baker who lives in my town. He told me that it was an exciting experience.\n\nI think that you give us a lot of information about the programme, and your opinion about it is very interesting.\n\nI really like your review!!\n",

I´ll have plenty of time to do what I want, however I would like to spend my time in the right things. Can you help me?\n\nFirst of all, the first two months, I would like to find an English academy. Improving my English language it´s the best way to apply for a job. I´ve just finished my teacher degree and I have experience in schools, could you send me any webpage where I can find more information about how to apply for a job in the UK? I think that it could be a great opportunity to improve my English skills and learn lots of things about the UK culture. I´ve copied my CV at the end of the letter and if you know somewhere where they need a native Spanish speaker, please, contact me.\n\nI would like to save some money, and at the end of my UK experience, spend my time travelling around your country. Is it interesting? Could you tell me the most important attractions around your city? Send me some tourist information if you have. If you have days off I hope we can meet at the road and join me.\n\nHave a nice weekend. Best wishes \n\nGuillermo\n",

Music style and\nclothes wearing changes very quickly. Television series\nor movies do not really change, young people watch old \nshows and new ones by turns, so I can not say what TV\nprogrammes young people like to watch.\n\nNow, young people like different kind of music, I think\npop and disco music is something all young people like.\nBecause this kind of music connects them on party.\nIt soothes them, calms them, aggravates them, excites them.\nThat is why music is very import thing about this festival.\n\nClothes theme is harder like I said before, because fashion\nchanges swiftly. Clothes need to be open and free, simple enough.\nWe all want to feel good what we wear, I recommend hipi style \nclothes, not too hipi, but something comfortable. Of course \nit depends what season your doing the festival. When autumn, winter\ntime then I suggest some other style, it has to be comfotable but\nfashion enough. Maybe colorful and cool blankets when someone gets\ncold.\n\nAll in all, I think those tips help you and I hope you will\ngive those people one good international festival. \n",

  "text": "Whether movies and TV programs made in our own country are more interesting than movies and programs made in other countries has been widely discussed. Many people are of the opinion that domestic movies and TV programs are better than foreign ones. However, I strongly assert that movies and TV programs made in other countries are better for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, foreign movies and TV programs are more stimulating. To elaborate, their story are better as there are more twists and turns in plots. Although the plots full of turns, they still very reasonable, and not make their audience felt that the plots are very strange. Moreover, the special effect are better because foreign movies usually cost much more money than native to make. For example, the first one 3 dimensional movie, Avatar, the movie maker spend a lot of energy and time on developing the novel movie genre. It eventually made very good impression on its audience, and the most important for a commercial movie, it really did very well at the box office.\nAdditionally, people can learn more things from foreign TV programs and movies. Watching foreign TV programs and movies, their viewers can learn not only foreign language but also exotic cultures. Furthermore, foreign TV are more international and educational. For instance, we can know many foreign news from watching CNN. The news in CNN including events which are happening all over the world.  What's more, the National Geographic and Discovery also teach me a lot of information and knowledge which I can't learn from native programs.\nIn contrast, some people consider that domestic films are more familiar than foreign ones. They do not want to learn so much becuase they just watch movies for fun. There is some truth in the claims that watching movies and TV programs is a relaxed activity. However, I still consider that if people can learn some foreign culture, or appreciate the spirits which foreign films contain, they could get more reflection as recreating. Plus, watching foreign programs also could attain the goal of those people-- relaxation. \nIn sum, although there are some dissenting views, one can still safely come to the conclusion that foreign films and TV programs are more interesting than domestic movies and TV programs. Although movies in our own country are more popular than past, the foreign movies still play important role on domestic movie goer's mind\n",

On the one hand, most people have, at least, one television in their homes, so it is very accessible to everyone. For this reason, instead of entertaining, television should contain educative programmes.\nNowadays, children spend more time at home than before. They are used to manage different technologies as television or computer. I think that children can't be supervised for their parents all the time because they have to work and make home tasks. For this reason is important for them having a good educative programme on television. I' am not saying that television has to educate our children, but it has to offer programmes which make them revise essential things as numbers or letters. Television is very important to give language skills to children.\nWhen I was young I used to watch television every afternoon to learn interesting things as geography or maths and it helped me a lot. Television allowed me to learn how to speak Catalan correctly and it also gave me a good conversation issue to talk with friends.",

In particular every week you can find \"Il panino più\", a special roll created by the fancy of the cook. Of course I prefer to go to this pub with my family or with my friends, especially if I have to celebrate something, for example birthdays, anniversaries or something else. I remember, when one of my daughters celebrated her eighteenth birthday, the pub's owner put the number eighteen, made by cheese on the roll, with a little candle.\nWhen I go there I also drink a good mixed beer: half light beer and half red beer with of a good flavor. Of course with the roll we also order a lot of chips. If we are all that we are still hungry  we order cakes. They have many different cakes: profiterol, meringata, tiramisù and so on. Of course if the six of us go together is quite expensive, but if I go only with my husband I don't spend so much.\nI suggest everyone go to this place because not only is the food good but also the owners are very friendly. The only problem is to find parking space because this pub is in a narrow road where it is not easy to find space to park the car. But if you are lucky you can park.\n",

There are also positive things that we have to take into consideration before to condemn it.\nFor example, the wider choose of programs from all over the World, allow us to discover new cultures, new languages and new societies without travelling, and this enhance our knowledge.\nIn addition to that, the cost of the television as an entertainment form compared to the cinema, the theatre or Opera is cheaper and affordable by everyone. \nAlso, it is very important to remember that we have always the possibility to choose what we want to watch and when.\n\nTo sum-up, I think television is a very good value for money, the point is  being able to choose what we want to watch.\n",

  "text": "Famous people are exposed to criticism and public opinion, but what does it mean? \nFirstly, there are two kinds of famous people: those who want to have a private life and who don’t want everybody knowing each aspect of their lives and those who sell certain parts of their lives in magazines, journals or TV programmes or their entire private life.\nSecondly, taking this into account, I think that everybody has the right of having a private life and the right of living without journalists following them to everywhere. It's true that their lives are too much exposed and they cannot have a normal life. Of course, they can control that by complaining in a trial.\nThirdly, in my opinion they have the right also of selling only the parts of their lives they want. But in contrast, there is the problem of when they should stop, and journalists continue selling information or pictures and it could arrive an embarrassing moment and if you have sold a kind of things like this before you can’t say nothing.\nTo summarize, I believe that everybody deserve to have a private life. When it doesn’t occur, they have to go to trials.\n",

I am currently working at a place where I am getting a great wage so I have the possibility to accompany you on your journey. We might go to the most representative places of Mexico such as: Templo mayor, Cancún, Acapulco, among many others.\n\nIn mexico, a foreign person do not face difficulties to be hired by a company. I would be pleased to help you with this part of your experience in my contry. I know that you are someone who loves animals, perhaps we can go to the city zoo in order to verify wheter there are any vacancies that fit with you.\n\nSomething I can do is to make some research about the places that need people who speak Englsih fluently. As you know, in this country if you are someone who speaks more than 1 language, you have the chances to obtain a great job.\n\nPlease let me know if you need something extra while you are here. Maybe a special diet, special clothes or any kind of thing you might need that will not be easy to find here.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLuis\n\n",

It is performed one  after the other according to their age groups.  Wrestling is new sport, which is unknown to many of my colleagues at the College.  It is played by both boys and girls. Wrestling is performed during the night time when the moon light is on. Wrestling  is contested by two people while others wait for their turns respectively. It starts with a drumming and singing by young girls of the community. This were all the beautiful girl are shown to the young men of the community. It is another method of admiring girls.  Wrestling is both interesting and entertaining sport. \n\nTraditionally, we provide a firewood as a means of light at night for the sport.  It takes place in the middle of the village where there are enough space for the spectators. Before the contest starts.  Referee advise players about the rules of the game.As such, referee explains the rules of the game through their captains i.e.  Health and Safety. The game starts with dancing and singing.   Refreshments are on sale at a discounted price to visiting team.\n This is a sport performed by young people only. The rationale for the College are: to educate the student about our culture, ritual, values and out ways of life in the village.\n",

  "text": "First of all  I lived in London for three weeks in 2012. I am a teacher in a High School  and the authorities in my country let me stay there, improving my English. I would like to say that learning any languages is complicated to someone , whatever you come from, but  in my opinion there are many matter to discuss. \n\nA good ilustration of this would be children. One child whose parents come from different countries  is able to learn two languages at the same time, this child doesn't need to go abroad to learn a foreign language, but they are listening to their parents speaking English their native language all the time and this let them learn without any difficulty.\nOn the other hand, if you go  abroad you will be able to improve your English in anglophone country, in this case, your knowledge will be reinforced with your stay there.\nTo sum up, if you want to learn English you don't need  to go  abroad, you can improve your English working hard  inside your own country , for example, doing exercises like listening and writing or you can meet with native people who speak English to practise with them. But if you have one opportunity to go  abroad, this would be so good for you and your English.",

Young people can enjoy going to the cinema in the city center after having some \"tapas\" and some drinks. Also, it would be a good idea go to the beach to spend the day and play volleyball or sunbathing, because this it is always a good plan.\nValencia, has different areas to go out in the evening, but some of them required the passport, so if you are younger than 18 it would be difficult to enter.\nMoreover, you can go to eat \"Paella\" and ride around the \"Albufera\" of Valencia in a small boat. However, the art and science museum, it could be the funniest plan.\n\nOther activities in the surroundings.\nIn addition i suggested going by bus around the surroundings of the city, where you can do adventure sports, like canoening, climbing or just walking around the mountains and enjoy the countryside\n\nRecommendations\n I recommend that they should do both activities, Valencia city and also de the surroundings. Maybe I could check if I can bring you some free tickets for the public transport. It would be great!",

  "text": "Now I will further developed our last statement. As Lloyd Cohen (the Director of the Worldwide Market Analysis) said lottery play is not economically irrational and uninformed. He presents a theory in which buying lottery tickets is not a misguided input into wealth production as some critics believe, but a valuable input into creating a sense of possibilty from scaping from one’s current life by acquiring wealth.\n\nIt is certainly true that people who play are almost certain to lose money. Cohen’s knwoledge is that playing the lottery is not automatically irrational. Some people like to calculated the gain or lose from buying the lottery but other people that can afford a dolar ticket now prefer to keep their dreams. People don’t invest the money they spend on lottery. They spend it and get those dreams in return. \n\nThough this has been an amusing debate, we the affirmative side, on the weight of our argument and proof, have concluded that lottery shouldn’t be banned in the US and Spain, because it is a tradition, it gives help, hope and support to public entities and it must be a rational investment.\n",

First of all you should find the entrance of the airport.  Then you should know that you there will be two kinds of transport. Taxy is the first variant. It's the quickest way to come to my home but at the same time it's more expensive. Also you can use the bus. You should write me the exact time of your plane arrival. Then I'll write back the timetable of bus arrivals. It might be more boring way to my home but I like it for the price. When you hear the bus stop Ploshad Truda you should leave the bus and I'll meet you at this bus stop. \nIn my opinion the weather is better today than yesterday. But it has been raining for four days. So it would be very well if you take a warm coat and an umbrella.\n\nHoping to see you soon,\nyour friend, Semyon.",

Several bathrooms are available with cold and hot water in them and a 25 metre-length heated pool.\nAs far as I am concerned there are some pros and cons about the use of the swimming pool. On the one hand everything is very cleaned including floor, bath and corridors, in addition, if you are a disabled person you will not have any trouble to get there because there are  some ramps to help you come in. On the other hand you will have to pay 45 euros a month to use facilities, and besides, you will not be able to do exercises because there is not any gym inside the building.\nIn my opinion the swimming pool is convenient because you can walk to swim if you live in town but is very expensive, particularly for young people. \nI suggest that prices should be lower than they actually are.\n",

It's a large space with a lot of shops, so we need much time to visit all of them. After a few hours we are so tired, that we do not have power to do anything else. Besides, in the shopping centres there's a loud energetic music played all the time and a crowd of people, so we get home with a huge headache.\nMoney is another reason why we do not always enjoy the shopping. We live in a time of acquisitiveness and people buy many things, even if they can't afford it. Of course, people usually do not need all of those things. This behaviour causes a moral hangover and a spiral of credit.\nTimes in which we live are conducive to addictions. People addicted to shopping in the long run do not enjoy this ritual anymore - they do it just because they have to, although they have no money and no space at home for all those things they buy.\nI think we should learn to buy only things we really need and we can afford.

In contrast, in Taiwan, we have our own currency and the government is efficient and well-organized. Clearly, Taiwan will not be the next Greece.\n\nMonetary policy could be a very useful short term financial tool for a government to stimulate its worsening economy, and, from the empirical experience, many countries have successful applied such policy. In 2012, Japanese central bank unprecedented depreciated Yuan, which has obviously improved its exports and recovered its economy from stagnation. Obviously, Taiwan has its own currency, new Taiwan dollar, and if Taiwan’s economy is worsening someday, Taiwanese government could simply mimic what Japanese government did in 2012.\n\nNot only Taiwan is different from Greece in currency sovereignty, it also wins in government’s efficiency. According to a global survey, Taiwan wins reputation in effectiveness, in which Taiwan government has legislated severe laws to prevent corruption. Therefore, Taiwanese have to pay taxes by regulation and do not dare to evade taxes. Without a doubt, the efficacy of Taiwanese government is beneficial to people’s welfare.\n\nAll in all, Taiwan has currency sovereignty and is well-known for its effectiveness.

  "text": "The pie chart shows the principal causes which justify why agricultural lands became less productive, whereas the table correlates these causes with three different regions of the world which had land degraded, namely North America, Europe and Oceania, during the 1990s.\n\nOverall, it is clear that the main causes for land degredation were deforestation and over-grazing. These causes also had a negative impact on two regions that were analysed, in Europe and Oceania, and, consequently, these areas had higher rates in terms of total land degreaded.\n\nA closer look at the pie chart reveals that over-grazing was the most important reason why land was so degraded, with the highest percentage of 35%. This was followed by the deforestation, with 30%, while over-cultivation had 28%. Finally, 7% could be explained for other reasons. It may be justified by the fact that there was an excess of chemicals in the agricultural activity. This also needs to be compared to the table. Not surprisingly, these causes played an important role when we talk about the percentage of land which was affected by these causes, particularly in Europe and Oceania. In the first case, Europe reprented the highest percentage of land degraded caused by deforestation and over-cultivation, 9.8% and 7.7% respectively. This was a great impact on total land degraded as Europe was more affected, with a total of 23%. By another side, Oceania had the highest land degraded rate at 11.3% bacause of over-grazing, which also contributed to having 13% of land degraded. By contrast, in general North America had the lowest rates in deforestation and over-grazing, with 0.2% and 1.5% respectively. for this resaon, this region presented the lowest percentage of land degraded, with only 5%.

  "text": "ARE YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS YOUR BEST FRIENDS?\nFirstly, I must say that I don’t consider that my family members are my best friends, not only because they have other problems to care about but also because I don’t know how to tell them my problems. \nHowever, we consider a friend that person you can have fun with, laugh and meet. I'm use to do that with my parents and my brothers but it’s not the same as when I meet my best friends. \nMoreover, I think that I shouldn’t ask them to have what we call a “therapy moment” as I do with my best friends when I’m worried for something or someone, in fact I wouldn’t know how to start telling them about that. \nSome teenagers have the luck to be open-minded and they know how to speak with their parents and it’s a good way to solve problems. \nIn my opinion I think that I should have more confidence with my family and remember that they won’t leave me for something I had done in other way my best friends can do. \n",

At present there are many means of transportation. The technology brought about lots of development in transportation. We can travel by air using the aircraft, aeroplane, helcopter and rest. Unlike before we have big ships to use on the sea. The train is also  a very useful means of transportation and very economical.

Michael had always seen her in the hallways, smiling and laughing. Anywhere she went, she was always surrounded by a handful of students. People got attracted towards her quite easily and often, they would find themselves adoring and admiring her. Although she wasn't pretty, she had an aura of importance. Her presence was felt. She was popular but not proud, and that made her even more likable by all. All but one - Michael.\n Whenever, he saw her, he felt pain. Pain of jealousy. A fire of hatred burnt his heart whenever he heard her gleeful laughter. All his life, he had only wished to be popular but his dream of popularity had been long ago snatched by a girl. That girl, who had once been his best friend. That girl who had left him in need of time. That girl who had done nothing but harm for him. She was Sara. His long lost best friend Sara.\n That night had changed their lives. Both of their lives. In every way, in every form. An innocent dare made by Sara which led Michael to walk in a path of wrong. A dare to prove.  courage can change lives\n\nHe was isolated. Abandoned by his friends. All was a façade. They had all worn masks. Everyone, even his own Sara.\n He had been wrong. All along he was wrong. They hadn't isolated him, rather he had. They hadn't abandoned him neither had they distanced themselves from him. He had distanced himself from them. His Sara was there, all along she was there for him.In the first place, she never left him. She had always wanted to be with him but he had closed the door for her. Yet, she waited, hoping he would realise she would always be there for him.\n Tears were streaming down his face. Stinging his eyes. He deserved it. Every bit of pain. He had been blind by rage. All these years. His selfishness stood in the way. His delusions had drifted him away from her. He had done such a huge mistake. No tears or sorrys would make a less culprit. No one should forgive him for what he did. No one.\n Right now, he has the one thing he always wished for - popularity, but only now does he realise, that it was meaningless, point less.\n Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.\n Each and every colour glow in the dark giving hope out of the darkness.\n",

  "text": "In this essay, I am going to discuss whether building a bypass around our town is beneficial to our community or not. \n\nOne of the advantages pointed out by local politicians in the meeting was that this bypass would lower the rate of air pollution around town, which I highly agree with because the extra traffic caused due to the passing cars added to the vehicles used by the locals cause massive smog in the atmosphere, not to mention being terribly bad to the health of the walking, cycling citizens, especially young children, babies.\n\nAnother important point is that this bypass would improve the traffic in the town center. Mostly during 7 to 8 am and 3 to 4 pm, when people go and finish work, that is when we get the most awful traffic jams, sometimes it takes an hour to get form point A to B in town which is a terribly long time not to mention parents who have to take their children to school, nursery and then get to work, too. \n\nOn the other hand the bypass might cause a drastic drop in tourism in the town. However, it is also true to say that people who are actually interested in historical sites would visit the town anyway. \n\nAll in all, I would say the bypass would be more of a disadvantage than advantage, because it would cut us off from people and the town would receive less funding if it's less important. Local politicians should focus on sustainability, using vehicles which do not harm the environment.\n\n",

Else the ticket for the concert I bought the VIP ticket as well, so I had to go before to Birmingham, because the entrance to the venue was at 17:00 and as I live close to London, I had to leave at about 12:00 so I didn't have to rush. I got to Birmingham at 14:00, I think, and then, as I've never been to Birmingham I had to look for the 02 Academy, where the event took place. When I arrived there, I queued for the VIP queue. At 17:00 they let us in the venue and they made all the checkings. After 30 minutes started the acoustic performance which lasted for about 15 minutes, afterwards we took pictures. When everybody took their photos, Emblem3 got backstage to get ready for the concert and after one hour it sterted. I left the arena at midnight and I went to an hotel that I did already book online.

  "text": "After cars prevailed among the public, our governments have tried to pave rough roads, which promotes people to use cars even more. Nowadays, it might be argued if the current transportation system would be working in the future like present, while there is a still big room for public transportation remaining as a significant method. This essay will offer a couple of points about whether public transportation will still be around us or if it will disappear completely.\n\nFor a start, the convenience for us to travel around would probably be one of the main arguments. In some countries, the amount of transportation such as train is not sufficient, which forces people to use private cars. However, it is also true that there are always minors who have no choice but to take public transport and also for their parents it is definitely more reliable. \n\nWhat is also important is the impact on the environment, which is already considerably damaged by human technology. If a car which emits no serious global warming gas would be developed, there would be no argument that people had better reduce our use of cars, yet, as long as we are manufacturing them we could not find more eco-friendly and efficient ways than public transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that it is not possible for public transport to disappear in the future even though travelling with cars is more convenient than travelling with just trains or buses. But in the same way as cars development, our governments might have to make some progress on public transport to encourage citizens to be more eco-friendly.",

  "text": "All my life I practiced sports, but definitely my favorite sport is squash. I started to training when I was ten years old. I had never played a raquet´s sport before, so I was very excited to hit the small black ball with my racket. \n\nThree times a week I played, then I went more often. The first year I went to a tournament in Torreon and I win the first place, during the first 3 years I was ranking in the first 10 places of Mexico, but then I had to reduce my practices because I had a problem with my knees. \n\nPlay squash is an awesome activity and is easy to learn, I love that this game is very fast and you do a lot of exercise. The bad news is that in Mexico is not very common, so it´s a little bit difficult to find a field and is expensive, more or less the price per hour is $150 pesos.  \n\nFor someone new in this sport I would recommended be patient and constant in the training, because the practice is what make you better and helps to improve your level, and finally always enjoy the game. \n\n",

In second place, it is not enjoyable to wait for the bus or the underground. On the other hand, there are a number of reasons against the end of the public transport. For example, you must take public transport instead the car because it produces less pollution.

  "text": "“ There is no future for public transport because travelling by car is so much more convenient”\n         In my opinion less people are travelling by public transport and started to buy their own cars which is more comfortable to use whenever you are in a hurry or not.\n          In the first place you feel more comfortable in your own car than in a bus for example. You don’t need fear that someone could suddenly stole your purse or you don’t have to listen to the others when you travel by your car. Studies have shown that your self esteem and feelings of protection increase when you are a car driver.\n       You don’t have to indulge staying in a crowded place with people you don’t know. Saving some money and buy a car is the best thing you can do. In the second place not all public transports are in their best shape. Some of them are dirty and smell. If you have your own car these things don’t bother you anymore cause you wash your car anytime you want. \n           In conclusion travelling by car is far better than using public transport\n",

Spain  must be really incredible!\nI'm writing to you to tell you about the U2 concert, which took place in \"Spodek\" arena in Katowice last month. I must admit that this is my favourite band. I've always wanted to see them live and finally my dreams came true. \nThe best of it was that I saw them really close, because of my dad's work. As you know, he works in security company, called Solid Safety and he was appointed to be a bodyguard to even Bono! Could you imagine my reaction, when he told me about it. Of course, then he handed in two \"Staff\" tickets to me. These tickets allow you to get in to the VIP zone. I invited my classmate Sally and we went on a concert together. We were so excited, when we got on. Before the show we were helping in  placing a sounding equipment. \nDuring the concert we were standing on the backstage. Where could be better?! After the last song my dad took us to the Bono's room. He was signing autographs and chatting with fans. I will never forget it. My dad took even a photo of us with him. I must say, he is much more handsome in live that on the TV.\nThat's all for now, but I will write more, when I find my feet! I will appreciate my dad's work forever.  Give my regards to your parents!\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLove, Lisa\n",

In winter it is fine we can adjust in crowd but if we talk about summer session we cannot adjust when we are travelling in a suffocated environment.  \n\nWe need to book tickets in advance, in case we are planning to go via public transport because again the issue of availability of seats are there.",

  "text": "I live in Trieste, a very beautiful city, but this city has a great problem: it has a lot of cars, more than inhabitants. Of course it's an exaggeration, but I say this to confirm that in this city the number of the cars is very high. By the way, the public transport is not so convenient, because at a certain hours you cannot find bus. In our city the buses stop at midnight. Also the ticket price is not cheap. Another problem of the buses is that if you take one during certain hours, it's impossible to find a place free to sit down. So travelling by bus is not convenient, not only for time but also for the problems that you can find. The other question is that Trieste is situated near Slovenia, where, the price of petrol is cheaper than in Italy, so a great number of inhabitants of our city prefer to fuel the car directly in Slovenia, where they can find much more competitive prices. My father lives in Pordenone and he sells cars. He wants to convince me to use alternative means of transport, but after I see the price of this ecological vehicle I considered that I'll buy one of them only if the price becomes\nloverer.",

  "text": "Currently, people think about if they can get good english in my country or have to move to english speaking country. And after that, it depends on the personality, status( single, engaged or married), and even the ages of people, they will decide to learn in their own country or go abroad for getting english.\n\nOn the hand, studying abroad is a great opportunity, especially for young people. They usually go abroad because they have not so much responsibilities just it prepares their professional future. But They can only afford it to work as a au pair, waiter, kitchen porter or porter that include accommodation, normal wages and you don´t need high level of english.\n\nOn the other hand, you might find yourself getting homesick. Of course, you leave a lot of things, such as your family, friends, foods, places, own things, etc., and nobody put up with being very far away from all these things. Moreover, people about mid´s 30 years old, they do not usually leave their country and try to get new language from are living. This way is cheap as well and they have not to change everything around their life to achieve this aim. In addition, with this ages, normally people have more charges, maybe children, mortgage, partner, etc. \n\nFrom my opinion, the best way for learning really good a language it is living in the same country where people speak it. So, you don´t hesitate and move to the new country, in which you do not only get language, even different culture and lifestyle. ",

Since 2010 my town has tried to include some changes to boost the town.\nRecycling is the solution\nIn the last five years many new bins have been situated near all neighbourhoods. There are four type of rubbish skip. On one of these bins are destined to plastics, another one is for wood and paper, the third one is a bottlebank and the last one is for cells. This one is very important because it contaminates so much. Apart from that, there are other container focused on every type of objects. For instance, clothes, shoes, toys, electronic devices, etc.\nMore green areas\nThis town has not only focused on recycling, it has also promoted green areas. Because of that 5 new parks has been created recently. Those are a great place where families have a good time while they enjoy the countryside. Moreover residents have become more conscious after they have read the leaflets which explain the importance of respect the environment.\nConclusion\nI strongly think that it is necessary to make people conscious about the importance of save the planet. In addition, more people would help if they can recycle easily.",

It´s true that we don´t pay attention to our grandma´s.\n She loves us and she always looks after us when dad and mum couldn’t do it. I believe that we haven´t never thanked her what she did and do for us. For that I´ve had the idea of giving her a present. You´re agree with me, aren´t you? \nYesterday I saw a nice present for her in the new mall of Jerez, called AreaSur. It was an amazing gold watch. It seemed not to be very expensive and was luxury and lovely. I think that a clock would be useful as well as necessary for her. What do you think about buying it for her? If you don´t think the same as me you can choose another present, I won´t have any problem.\nAnyway, we should go to the mall together and there we will take the final decision. We can go by bus. You only have to walk through the road in front of home and you will arrive bus station. Then take the third line and two stops later you will arrive mall. I will see you there and I´ll guide you in the mall.\nI hope to see you soon brother.\nSend me an email when you´re able to go shopping\nQuique\n\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "What’s the safest transport in the world? And the most comfortable? In my opinion any transport is completely safe, however people say the plane is the safest transport.\nAnd, maybe the car is the most comfortable. It is true that both are advantages and disadvantages.\n\nTravelling by car can be enjoyable, dangerous and relaxing, I knew this is a contradiction, but I can explain it. Relaxing because you can travel by yourself, with friends and with your family. When you make a long trip you can go without pressure. If you are tired you can stop at a petrol station or at a restaurant to relax yourself, and if in the car there are more passengers you can change with them, so you will feel less tired.\n\nEven travel by car, in my opinion, has a lot of problems. Some advantages could be:\n\n-\tGasoline is too expensive\n-\t There aren’t enough car parks and they are very expensive, for example when you travel to Madrid it is impossible to find a free parking. \n-\tOften you can be involved in city traffic jams, especially in the rush hour. This situation only is present in Caceres when there is a rainy day, but in other cities like Madrid, Barcelona… is a daily situation.\n\nI think, driving can be dangerous because people must respect speed limits, and not every time that it is. People doesn´t wear the seatbelt, use phones, and even there are who drink when they are going to drive. All these malpractice can make they have an accident and other innocent persons are in danger.\n\nEvery holiday, the DGT, in Spain, make an awareness campaign to remember us the good manners when we are driving. \n\nOn the other hand, travelling by plane people say is safer then do it in others transport.  I don´t make sure this affirmation. I´m afraid to travel by plane. I hate the moment when the plane is taking off, and when it is touching off. I´m afraid so that started when I was travelling to Mexico in my honeymoon. In this moment there was a tropical storm, and the turbulences are horrible; but a not time I have stopped to travel by plane. I knew is the better option when you want to travel abroad. \n\nIt is true, that plane is very expensive, at least I never haven´t be able to book a cheap ticket. I look for the perfect offer but in summer it is impossible to find it.\n\nTo sun up, all kind of transport have positive and negative aspects, but depending of our necessity we use one or another. For example there are a lot of countries where bike is the most main of transport, like Belgium. I remember there were kilometres and kilometres of cycle line, on the contrary than here in Spain, where few cities like Madrid or Barcelona, strengthen their use.\n",

Is that present for me?” I asked myself quietly. Besides I was not sure whether I should take it up.\n\nI looked around one more time but still I didn’t see anyone. As it was quite early in the morning there was just silence everywhere.\n\nI sat down in my kitchen and put the present on the table. But before opening it I decided to make a cup of green tea to calm down a bit as I felt nervous enough. While the water was boiling a lot of different thoughts came into my head:  „I don’t have any birthday today and there are few more months until Christmas... What could be the reason for such a nice present wrapped in a pink paper? Maybe someone wishes to make some little surprise for me, doesn’t he?” „Ok, lets open it!” I encouraged myself.\n\nOh, if you knew – that present made my day! When I opened it I found there my favourite chocolate with very cute ‘Thank you’ letter. I got it from my neighbour and he just was so thankful for my help tidying up his garden week before.\nActually I love receiving presents. \n\nThey colour the world, they lift you up!

To support this idea, a study was conducted 6 months ago. The study tried to explain people's reaction to different resources. People where given the task to write a piece of writing of their choice using the resources already provided by the institution in charge. Firstly, they were given 5 books of different subjects. Out of 20 tested people, 17 managed to write their composition within an hour. Secondly, keeping the main task, they were given a tablet with wireless connection to use instead of books. This time the study showed that all of the applicants managed to write their essays in less than 30 minutes.\n  The objective of this study was to see how people adapted to new technologies and how our cultural roots are being forgotten. Thus, this study concluded that in around 50 years from now, people will have worked, fed, showered and even lived without leaving there homes. If technology is leading to those kinds of consequences, we should start to realise how to use technology properly without needing to eliminate it.",

  "text": "WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENVIRONMENT\n\nIntroduction\nThe aim of this report is to inform about the ways in which my village carries out measures to look after the environment. For this, we will analyse several aspects such as what local residents do with the rubbish and how Lanjarón tries to keep the area clean and makes it attractive to people.\n\nRecycling: The best way to deal with the rubbish\nNowadays there is more and more rubbish because of the high amount of package used to wrap products and increase in consumption. In Lanjarón as in the rest of the villages and towns people are getting used to buying and consuming much more than they used to do in the past. However, in recent years my village has been promoting ways for people to get ride of the rubbish in a conscious way. A number of recycling bins have been placed around the village and citizens are being encouraged to join several ongoing courses to raise their awareness of the importance of recycling. For these reasons, what people usually do with their rubbish in their daily routine is to sort it and put it in the correct bin. \n\nKeeping the village clean and attractive\nLanjarón is one of the most tourist villages in the region La Alpujarra; therefore, it is very important both for the council and the local residents to keep the village clean. To get this the council sets different environmental activities for the citizens to take part in. For instance, monthly it is held a competition where participants have to clean and pick rubbish up from different areas of the village. At the end of the competition those whose area is cleaner and attractive receive an award. \n\nConclusion\nWe have to bear in mind how important the environment is to us. If we all were aware of this and did something to help it in our daily routines, the planet would thank us for this. ",

  "text": "\tThere are two opposite opinions about military service. On one, hand military service must be mandatory. Others consider that it is military service is unnecessary and should be voluntary.\n\tFirst of all, there is no absolutely safety in the modern world. There are different dangers of a military nature such as terrorist attacks, wars and other armed conflicts. Therefore, compulsory service at in the army gives special military knowledge, which helps the population to protect their country during a military conflict. As a result, there are more chances to overcome the conflict with minimum human losses. \nSecondly, the mandatory military service can develop  the character of a person, making it stronger. More specifically, it allows for understanding of teamwork, develops organizational skills and practice discipline. Moreover, it can educate young people be more self-reliant, because the majority of teenagers at the age of 18 do not know how to be independent from their parents.   \nHowever, the critics claim that obligatory military service is a waste of time and has a negative impact. For example, it is difficult to find a good job or go to university after military service, because during the one or two years of service, soldiers do not develop any knowledge except military. Also, the time spent serving in the army can uproot or separate families or friends’ relations.\nAnother big problem is that military service is dangerous and has a risk. There are different physical exercises that can be harmful to health. Besides, there are emergencies, which can happen with guns or weapons such as explosions and accidents. Furthermore, there are hazing acts at in the army. It means that soldiers who have already served some time, bully and beat up new recruits for fun. These acts often turn out to be tragic having a long post traumatic effect on the young person or even loss of life. Army years often have an impact on the whole family, especially in case of bullying or the possibility of being sent to the warzone. \nFinally, there is a very complex topic and both opinions have advantages and disadvantages, but it can be seen that the military situation is unstable in the world. This means that people need to know how to protect themselves and military services is a good way for it. \n\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "I prefer to eat at home\nFirstly, the food I make by myself is more trustful than the food that is made in restaurants. Because I don’t know what kinds of ingredients the restaurant put. Also the food I make by myself is much healthier. Because all of the restaurants want to earn money, so they will just use cheap and not healthy ingredients to cook the food. But if I make my own food, of course I won’t use any kind of unhealthy ingredients. So the food I made by my own hands is safer than any other food that is made in restaurants. And also homemade food has better quality than low price restaurants. \nSecondly, it’s much cheaper to eat at home, because restaurants want to earn money. So you can save lots of money if you cook at home. Some people think cooking themselves is too annoying or tired so they go out to eat. But actually if you cook much you can use your energy so you can consume your weight. Also if you cook three times a day your cooking ability will go up. \nThirdly, eating at home is more comfortable. When people are surrounded by strangers people all think they are watching me so I can’t do that or this. But if you eat at home you don’t need to be caring that somebody will look at you open your mouth too big or talk too loud. Also the restaurant don’t know how much you can eat, so sometimes they give you too less food you don’t get full. Or sometimes they give you too much food so you have to throw it away. And as you know, throwing food away is a bad habit to do which makes our planet, Earth will be polluted\nFourthly, you won’t have to waste your time going out to find a restaurant and come back home. And sometimes if there are many customers you have to wait for the chef to cook other’s food first. You can save time if you eat at home. \nFifthly, we can have a family time while eating. Of course, it doesn’t mean that you can’t talk with families when you eat outside. But if you eat at home with your family you can have a joke while preparing dishes or talk about their own private life things.

Fifteen years ago cell phones didn't have music or a camera, while nowadays they have camera with high definition and you can download a lot of music.\n\nOn the other hand we have transport. Right now people are starting to buy hydraulic cars which is more eco friendly and cheaper because you don't need to spend money in gas. Basing on this we can assume that this kind of cars will be the only ones on the streets fifty years from now.\n\nScience will also change.

For most of friends in the dorm of University of Education,Mimi is just an ordinary girl, neither beautiful nor smart.But for Michael, she is his world. He loves Michael at first sight when he first met and tried to take any advantages of opportunities to win her heart.There is no doubt that the Southerner in Vietnam have prejudices against Northerner for a long time. It is unfortunate for Michael to get access to her because she is a Southerner. Overcoming much prejudices and obstacles from her family, he proved to be a loyal and sincere man who Mimi can lay her hope on. But everything has changed since he came to Danang city to further study. He began to have intimate relationships with other beautiful young girls there and broke his promises- \" Wait for me! I love you forever and I will come back very soon.I'll never love any girls but you\". In terms of love, he didn't love her anymore but he still kept contact with her. Poor Mimi!. She didn't know anything and still waited in pain. She could have got married with a talented man if she hadn't believed in what Michael had said to her. Everything is fine until the end of last summer when she had some days off and made an important decision to go on a holiday trip to visit her boyfriend  without any notice for him as a resault of causing completely surprises. Never in her life had she been to as crowded a city as Danang so she feft very nervous but extremely excited about meeting her lover soon. Right after from taking off the plane, she traveled to his dorm to meet him with a view of satisfying her long waiting for him. The more excited she is, the more dissappointment she had. Mimi catch sight of her lover was kissing another young girl in his room. She burst into tears making efforts to leave that room as fast as possible.

Dont forget to have time enough to go out with your family and friends there! If I were you , I would try a period of proof for a month. If you don't follow the schedule, you should give up one of them. For instance, you have been doing sport since I met you so as to give up it for a season. Don't you think so?\n\nI hope that's useful.good luck and let me know how you get on.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon",

  "text": "Although the two movies are of complete different genres, similarities still exist. The stories of Stephanie and Ali in Rust and Bones, and Pat and Tiffany in the Silverlinings Playbook all began with their lives going through life-altering events. In Rust and Bones, Stephanie injures herself in a brawl outside of a club and wakes up to realize she had her legs amputated. Ali, an unemployed father in his mid-20s who is struggling to make ends meet and support his young son, saves Stephanie and helps her get back on her feet. As they support each other through their hardships, love stems.  Similarly, Pat and Tiffany were also going through hard times when they first met. Pat had just gotten out of rehab for bipolar disorder whereas Tiffany, a widow, who had just lost her job. Once again, their relationship began as friends and transforms into love as they help each other conquer personal challenges. In sum, both movies portrayed love as a chemistry reaction that stems out when two people willing to help each other out of life challenges. \n\nIn the movie of Rust and Bone, Ali takes Stephanie going out and swimming, even has sex with her, helping Stephanie to restore her life. On the other hand, after Ali starts his kickboxing career, Stephanie always cares about his conditions, then becomes his middleman. Same as Rust and Bone, in the movie of Silver Linings Playbook, Pat companies with Tiffany to break away from the past; and Tiffany help Pat to get the courage to find the way back into love. All they want to do is to repair the love meanings and find happiness in their life.\n\nBoth the movies lead happy endings to the leads. In the end of Rust and bone, Stephanie is back to her life because of Ali’s support. Ali realizes he loves Stephanie and he won’t be the man he used to be anymore, who don’t believe in love and only want one night stand. And in Silver Linings Playbook, Pat and Tiffany, who both used to stuck in their misfortune in the pass, leave their pass behind and move on with each other’s love and support. This two movies give us a concept : no matter how worse the lives are, love can make people brave and find out the value of lives again.\n\nAlbeit those things in common, at the beginning of the movies, the depression of characters came from different situation.  Pat and Tiffany are trapped in their psycologically difficulties; Pat’s desire of his ex-wife can not be fulfilled, while Tiffany can not get over her guilty of her husband’s death. However, characters in Rust and Bone are suffering from declined life quality; Stephanie lost her legs, and Ali is an impecunious man. Although their hearts are all empty, the harsh environment is more hard to survive. \n\nIn addition, love is portrayed in different ways in these two movies. Silver Linings Playbook, as a Hollywood movie, describes the love story in a hilarious tone. The scene is bright and the rhythm is light even if in the saddest  section. Rust and Bone, on the other hand, presents story in a realistic way. The director does not avoid brutal scenes because those are exactly parts of real life. In conclusion, every love movie may be interpreted in diverse ways, whereas people could always find distinct inspiration.\n",

  "text": "We shouldn`t underestimate the importance of societal and environmental problems. They both must be solved because of their great negative influence on the world.\nOn the one hand, I think that the most significant is societal problems because they cause other problems including environmental one. People always use nature and its resources to satisfy their needs. However, people have exploited the nature since the last century. Their activities caused lots of negative consequences such as air, water and land pollution, deforestation and climate change. These issues are so burning in developing countries. Whereas developed countries became aware of these problems, poor countries have plenty of societal problems, so they continue to influence the environment in a negative way. That`s why I consider that societal issues are the most dangerous. For example, developing countries cannot protect the environment because of their poverty, low incomes, and population illiteracy. \nOn the other hand, sometimes environmental problems can be a reason for societal one. It took place when some natural disasters happened. Such disasters as earthquakes, floods and tornados affect a lot of people every year. It has an unwilling impact on society as people are forced to save their lives, leave or renovate their houses, look for clothes, food and others.\nUnfortunately, we cannot pretend natural disasters, but we can solve societal problems. In my opinion, the main decision is to develop people`s potential, increase their awareness of personal effects on nature. If people take responsibility for their actions, we will avoid plenty of consequences. \nAs for me, we can achieve this through developing leadership. We must have strong leaders who will strive for a beautiful world. People can`t satisfy their limitless needs; they think only about their wealth. A good leader must form a society, show an example and provide better values for people. He must inspire others to achieve appropriate goals and to do their best for the world.\nIn my organization, we strive for peace in the world. We believe that we can develop leadership in each person and such ways we can avoid a lot of global problems. This exchange program will give me the required knowledge that I can use effectively to develop Ukrainian society. Sometimes I have an opportunity and desire to do something whereas I don`t know how to do it properly. I hope this international experience will teach me how to work on increasing country welfare. Though the new problems occur quickly in our state some people and community, try to do their best to develop the civil and democratic society. We need external help to find out how to cope with both societal and environment problems. Moreover, our country pays little attention to them so population should do everything on their own. For instance, I hope I will be able to get to know everything about recycling rubbish and economizing energy. These skills are necessary for us, and they help us to improve a little our ecological situation.\nIn conclusion, each problem must be solved concerning societal and environmental issues that impede a further progress of our civilization. What is more, this project will give me available experience including specific skills that I can use to spread healthy tendency in the social sphere and careful attitudes to the environment.\n\n",

Although they have a nice ending we need to remember that the real life is different and the difficult makes part of our lives, they are there to us to give value to everything we have and to remember us how fragile and, at the same time, how powerful we are.\nWe can also watch a documentary that teach us a lot! There are documentaries produced with so many careful that they provide us with a lot of information, sometimes it's much better than reading a book or having a class.\nHaving said that, we just need to remember to be aware of what we want to receive from TV while we are choosing a program to watch and be happy with our choices! \n\n",

  "text": "How does Shakespeare make 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' magical?\n\nIn 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' Shakespeare creates a magical mood and setting by using characters, such as the fairies, and events (such as transforming Bottom's head into a donkey's head). The use and misuse of magic of magic plays a vital role in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Each character in this play, who is able to do magic, uses it in a different way, for example: to help; for their own need.\nThe good use of magic is when Oberon use 'love in idleness' to make or rather \"force\" Demetrius to fall in love with Helena.  He uses it to help her and try to solve the problems in the lovers relation ship as Lysander and Demetrius are in love with Hermia consequently Helena in love with Demetrius. It's almost a love triangle!\nThe misuse of magic is when it causes an argument between the Athenians. As Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius and squeezes the potion into his eye, the whole conflict begins. This whole dispute could have been avoided if not for Puck's mistake. However, just as magic caused this chaos, it also resolved in it. Without the misuse of magic, the plot wouldn't be the same. There's be no humour to make it interesting.\nIn this play, the fairies are almost like the heart of the book. It is because of the magic of the fairies, the actions in this book is like a dream.  The fairies nearly control everything. The weather changes due to Oberon and Titania's argument, which makes 'contagious fogs'(2:1:90) and 'hoary-headed frosts'(2:1:107).  The fairies also affect nature as Oberon's and Titania's dispute results in the wind 'piping' to them in 'vain'(2:1:88).\nDue to having fairies as characters, it adds magic as fairies don't exist in the human world. It creates unreality and fantasy. The beautiful language of the fairies (verse) takes us away from the ordinary human world that usually talk in prose. The fairies' magic is built by the contrast of the lives of the fairies and \"mortals\".\nAs a reoccurring theme, Puck's use of magic creates humour, conflict and balance in the play. Puck's magic also adds to his naughty, cheeky, attractive character in this play. The magic of turning Bottom's head into one of an ass', adds more humour to already the self-confident character of Bottom. This also leads to more humour as Titania falls in love with Bottom and calls him her 'sweet love'(4:3:30). It also creates the comparison of Titania, a beautiful, delicate creature, whilst Bottom is completely grotesque.  The idea of Titania having a 'flowery bed'(4:1:1) and the idea of Bottom, at that time, looking 'monstrous' and 'strange'(3:1:91) creates a distinction. The image of the elegant fairy queen referring to a man with a donkey head as her 'lover'(3:2:186) seem ridiculous.\nOberon's use of magic is mainly used to help people. As well as for his need, he uses his magic to help 'A sweet Athenian lady' 'in love'(2:2:260) namely Helena with her situation with Demetrius in Act 2. Therefore, he is shown as a sympathetic character. However, Oberon also uses his magic to get the changeling boy from Titania. When Oberon finds out that Puck has transformed Bottom's head into a donkey's head, he gets annoyed at first at Puck's mistake but later realizes that Titania has fallen in love with a 'vile thing'(2:2:40), a man with an ass' head.\nIn the book, Titania doesn't seem to use her magic much ,nevertheless, she uses it a few times. Titania's uses her magic to 'bless'(5:1:383) the bride bed so that Theseus and Hippolyta would have beautiful children and live a happy, married life.  In the book, she isn't shown using it for her own need.\nTitania's fairies are also characters who use magic.  They use it to protect their 'fairy queen'(2:2:12) from 'spotted snakes with double tongue', 'newts and blindworms'(2:2:9-11). Their magic, like Oberon, is used to help people nevertheless not for themselves. Also, the fairies language is magical as most of their lines are spells and sound as if they were in a fairy tale.\nThe clothes of the fairies and their lives are also magical. The place where Titania sleeps is full of 'oxlips' and 'eglantine'. She sleeps on a bower and she wants a fan made of wings of butterflies. \nThe food they eat like 'apricocks'(3:1:152)  and 'mulberries' (3:1:153) sound exotic as well as not being our daily  meals or snacks which also shows another contrast between the humans and fairies. The fruits, used above, also sound like ones that would be found in a forest(berries).\nThe language of the fairies creates magic by imagery that is absolutely exquisite. Most of us probably haven't heard of 'oxlips' (2:2:250) and 'woodbine'(2:2:251). Even the sound of these two words sound like fantasy. Shakespeare's choice of words creates this. He talks about 'musk-roses'(2:1:252) and 'wild thyme'(2:2:249) giving us this image of this beautiful land, with green grass and all sorts of flowers. This image will probably look like where the fairies live or associate it with a fairy tale. By doing this, we begin to realize the magic in this play.\nIn 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' there are many spells, e.g.\nFlower of this purple dye,\nHit with Cupid's archery,\nSink in apple of his eye.\nWhen his love he doth espy,\nLet her shine as gloriously\nAs the Venus of the sky.\nWhen thou wak'st, if she be by,\nBeg of her remedy.\nOBERON(3:2:102-109)\nThe language used in this spell contains many references to nature ('Venus' and 'Sky'). This is how it creates magic and creates the setting as in William Shakespeare's time, they didn't use many props. Just by reading this, you can imagine this fairy king chanting a spell on a purple flower called 'love in idleness' and you can understand Cupid (the Greek god of love) had blessed this flower with his archery, giving you an understanding that this is a love potion. Shakespeare has also used metaphors and similes such as 'let  her shine as gloriously as the Venus of the sky' to create the thought that Helena should look like a 'goddess, nymph, ' in addition to being 'perfect' and 'divine'(3:2:137). He uses indirect word, e.g. He doesn't just say love potion. Shakespeare says 'Flower of this purple dye, Hit with Cupid's archery' causing mystery and letting us think about what he means.\nShakespeare also uses the idea of magic in his conversations with other characters for example: when Titania speaks to Oberon in 2:1:60-145 , she mentions nature many times. She refers to the Moon as 'the governess of floods'(2:1:103) and refers to the seasons quite a lot. She describes the winter as 'angry'(2:1:112) as Winter is sometimes thought of a miserable season. The fairies recite their sentences as if they were a poem or song. 'Spotted snakes' and 'Thorny hedgehogs'(2:2:9-10) are references to animals. Animals, insects and plants are commonly referred to in ''A Midsummers Night's Dream' and these descriptions add to the magic. It creates the sense that the fairies thought that the animals were dangerous and the way they describe them engages the reader. The description of the animals and insects makes them seem as if they were evil spirits to the fairies and spirits are magical.\nThis play also refers to 'sleep' and dreams. After all the book is called 'A Midsummers Night's Dream'. Due to the magic, the bizarre events were interpreted as a dream as there's be no easier way to make the humans understand the events that had just happened. Thinking of it as  a dream creates innocence and vulnerability. Also, the thought of all four lovers having the same dream makes it seem strange and magical to them.\nAlso, Shakespeare uses the thought of plays. He adds the play 'Pyramus and Thisbe' which is a bit like a mini play based on the storyline 'A Midsummers Night's Dream' as there are two lovers whose parents don't permit their marriage. When the 'mechanicals' or workers change into their characters, it is a bit like magic.  The characters in the play like 'moonlight' are basic ideas of transformations like ones that magic creates. Also, there is the idea of the alteration of form that Bottom's head gets 'translated'(3:1:104) expresses the magical feeling that again this is not possible in the human world.\nPotions are also used to show a sense of magic. In the human world, they didn't use spells or potions. At this time, the idea of potions might seem unrealistic and silly but by reading this and the events the potion conjures creates magic. The effect that 'love in idleness' has in the play, creates the plot and so potions play a main role in the book.\nWithout magic, the play would not have the same elements of humour. Also, the absence of magic would alter the overall plot. The repetitive theme of magic plays a significant role in the play. To summarize my points, I personally think that Shakespeare presented magic in the play by using thoughts such as transformations, spells, potions and aspects that don't exist in the human world. I personally think, without magic, this book will not be as popular or engaging. Shakespeare has done it again!\nBy Pravinija Mukherjee\n7Y",

  "text": "Nowadays most schools and universities are helping students to find their most suitable jobs. This is caused by the changes that the labor market has experimented recently. Enterprises want to recruit young and experienced people and universities and schools have noticed that so they are hands on the task. I shall consider two of the proposed methods.\nIt has been suggested to offer “work experience programs”. Students will be able to know deeply their task as employers. It seems a brilliant idea not only because of the knowledge that they acquire but for the experience that it could bring them. Some enterprises require experienced employers and if young people have it, they will be more likely to be recruited in the workplace. So, including in the CV the experience, seems to me, a step further in the students’ career.\n Another way to encourage students to find the perfect job would be courses and qualification. I entirely share this idea. Universities are supposed to give their students information about the skills that a work involves .But sometimes universities gives them more theoretical formations instead of practical formation which enterprises are searching. Generally speaking students finish their degrees with a limited range of experience.\nI would therefore argue that the best way to help students is to combine a kind of “training” for their work life and some theoretical knowledge. They have to learn the skills that a job involve and the only way to get this is practicing.\n",

  "text": "Now a day's we are having \"n\" number of International Sports, where one can prove their own talent and have their socialism. My favourite sport is Badminton because we can have  lots of fun while playing. The shape of the court is in rectangle and is divided in half by a net. The mode of playing can be single's or double's . There are six main shorts: the serve, the clear, the  smash, the drop, the forehand and the backhand.It's a good exercise to make one fit and easy to play. The fun in this game is we  need to drop the shuttlecock on the other side of the court and wait's until the opponent responses to it.  \n\n My suggestion  for the people who wants to start their hobby as badminton, firstly  one  need to know the rules and regulations of the play . As it's a mind set game, the player need to focus on the  weaknesses and  act accordingly . To be a successful player one has to  learn some tricks,which helps their game easier. And last but not least as a player one has to keep in mind that ,they should not get depressed when they feel that their game is going out of their hands, where instead of that one has to  fight until the last mint of the game in order to decide  whether  the player is winner or loser  . Thus by boosting themselves lead to success.",

  "text": "Some people argue that, when the weekend is coming they wonder what to do just for one day!They would like to have a rest. However, they want to go out and spend time with their families, as well. So, where to go? What to do?\nI'm suggesting you choose between two different places: beach or mountain. If you prefer to go to the beach but you are not sure what to do there, here are some special ideas to consider. \nFisrt of all, remember to take food that can be eaten easily without much mess (Spanish omelette, fried chicken brest, sandwiches, ships...) and, moreover, you can buy some drinks and water because it is fun to eat at the beach and people usually get hungry often after they do something like swimming, jumping the waves, surfing and so on. \nPlaying in the sand burying people one another or making sandcastles might be a great way to spend a day outdoors. \nNevertheless, if you don't like sand at all, you can choose the other option in the mountain. It could be a different way to spend a quiet day in a peaceful, placid and restful place. Furthermore, going on a hike among trees with a cool breeze around you can be the kind of place that allows you to forget the busy ciy life, though. \nTheerefore, which one of these two places would you choose?\nIn my opinion, no matter where you go, just take your camera and take photos in order to be able to remember that wonderful, amazing even unforgettable moment. At the end, the most important thing is to have and enjoy a relaxing time. ",

Different factors such as stress, psychological problems, noise, lights that do not let you rest. \"Sleep and Your Health\" talks about this. Mention 3 things we should do to sleep better and be healthy as well, which will discuss below.\n\nThe first step to better sleep is to recognize that maybe I can have a sleep disorder. Taking me as an example, I do not think I have a sleep disorder. I do not have trouble sleeping, or interrupt my sleep repeatedly. I sure do not get enough sleep but not a sleep disorder, if not, the pace of life I lead.\n\nThe second step is to identify what I could cause the sleep disorder. Even if you have a disorder, yes I can identify factors that may interrupt my sleep. The reading speech of many, but with whom I identify most is caffeine before sleeping and eating heavy before bedtime. I definitely need to pay attention to these factors and that way I can see improvement.\n\nThe third and final step is to try to identify problems at first. It is very important to know how we can improve our health. There are different medications or even natural things to improve these conditions. Help and put into practice these tips will help us have a healthier life.\n\nIn summary, it is important to pay attention to our health. Read things that can help us live better can be very helpful. Implement each council and tell others about your improvements, is a good way to help others. So for now we must sleep well to be healthier.",

  "text": "My favourite sport.\n\nLet me tell you about my favorite sport. I like many types of sports but I prefer swimming. Swimming is my favourite sport. I practise it every day in my school. We have a swimming pool in our school and we swim from 8a.m. to 10a.m. When I swim I feel very  happy and relaxed.\nThe benefits of swimming are that your body is healthy and your brain is alert.\n\nTo practise this sport first you have to meet someone who teaches you how to swim because it is a beautiful sport but it is also dangerous.You have to have a good coach and a good swimsuit.If you try it you can do it.\n\nKaren",

  "text": "Some people think there is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient. Cars actually have many advantages. However, it doesn't mean the public transport have to disappear.\n\nThe main reason to consider there is future for public transport is that, according to ecologists, we must cut down the massive use of cars. The pollution level is more and more increased by this excessive use. Then, the public transport is needed to avoid more problems in the atmosphere and save the planet. What's more, not only increases it the pollution, but also turns out to be dangerous for our sense of hearing.\n\nIn addition, I think the public transport is a necessary service which we should have access to. Everyone can't afford a car or, for any reason, aren't able to drive one. Therefore, it is too important to go on with a public transport business now and in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, people from all over the world would rather travel by car than travel by public transport but we'd better use this means of transport if we want to continue living in accurate conditions.\n",

  "text": "Dear Mr.Garo,\n\nPlease find below clarification related to the below issue:\n\nDuring a meeting with head of the department in MOH I was complaining about service of the microscope by their staffs (almost 99.9%from Olympus Microscopes are not under Service Contract, and handling by Electronic W/S in M.O.H.) and I suggested to provide the required training for his all staffs, in order to improve the quality of Olympus Microscopes service.\n\nNext day I have received a call from one of the technician Mr. Humam Altannous (who was compliant against us) and asking to repair the Microscopes in Malariya Lab (which are not under warranty or Contract).  I explained to him the standard protocol that it should be send a official repair request in order to proceed with repair the unit.\n\nBut he is not ready to accept it and asking us to come and repair the unit without any repair request issued. please note that our telephone conversation was only for 2 minutes and during this conversation he was misbehaving and mistreating me and hang-up the phone). He was not asking any Manual / trouble shooting instruction during our call what he mentioned in his email. \n\nNext day I was compliant against him with the Head of the department, during that time only I came to know that he is one of the technician who is taking care of repairs  of the Microscopes in the department, and his Manager requested me  to not repair any unit without official request, beside he will come back to me regarding my complaint against his employee.\n\nPlease note that we are keeping a good relation with our customers and always giving our good service as well.\n\nWe hope that above explanation is sufficiently clear and exhaustive.\n\nThanks for your kind understanding\n",

  "text": "Due to there will be an international festival for young people in our region, I have written that report in order to know the preferences of them and the trends which are on nowadays.\n\nFirstly, I have asked about the music that is listened to and about their favourites styles and groups and the results showed us that they aren't similar compared to music they liked a few years ago. In fact, they hardly ever can defined themselves such as pop fans, rockers,... In addition, plenty of girls who were interviewed told they couldn't stand reggaeton music, however they used to want to listen to it in discos because they could dance. In my opinion, young people don't have musical culture and magnificent bands of music like Rolling Stone are going to have remaining in the oblivion.\n\nSecondly, I debated with young people to television programmes that are watched currently. Most people prefer to watch reality programmes where people have to live with unknown people in order to gossip about them. However, the documetaries are being forgotten and only  a twenty-six percent of them would like watching more interesting TV series like Lost. Moreover, all of them choose watching TV against reading a book as first option.\n\nFinally, I also talked about the clothes they usually wear. It is said that you are that you are wearing but in this report, we can check that it is not certain. Actually, in opposition to the music, young people feel that they can reveal their behaviour and their character by which the clothes are being worn.\n\n",

  "text": "The statement - 'There is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient.' can be discussed in two different aspects. One way of using transport is to daily travel to work within the city, other way is to use it when you are visiting your friends or family outside the city. There have been good progress in transport in both the aspects. Transport has become faster and more convenient, and it can be attributed to lot of factors such as better roads, new technologies and innovations etc.\n          People who travel daily to work, usually prefer public transport over own car as it is a cheaper option. Also, as public transport such as metro do not need to face traffic, it is always faster way to reach office. On the other hand if I would be travelling to see my friends or family in nearby town or just on holiday tour, I would prefer my car. If you are travelling in your car, it gives you flexibility to choose any way to reach your destination, you can make any number of stoppage, and even stop for your favorite ice cream. In future; environment will also become a key factor in determining the state of these transport mediums. Countries today are trying to reduce their carbon footprints, they are trying to encourage public transport. This initiative will surely help countries to reduce pollution. ",

  "text": "Doing sports or just watching them?\n\nNowadays there are many people who practise sports, but other people prefer just watching them.\n\nOn the one hand, doing sports allows you to have a healthier life. Most doctors recommend doing this. Doing sports is a good way to forget about real life, you focus on the competition and is like to have a rest from the cotidian life.\n\nOn the other hand, doing sports is healthy, despite the fact that there are risky sports that can cause several health problems and could lead you to death, only watching sports seems safer.\n\nIn conclusion, personally despite the danger of some sports, doing sports is by far better than just sit in your house and watching them.",

Public transport is the vehicle for passenger who can travel from one place to another in less money. At first this transport was appreciated marvelously. Everyone felt so delighted but unfortunately now people feels uncomfortable when it comes to travel via public transport.\n\nIn early days of public transport, people were only stick to their normal routine and did not wish to earn more from their job or work. Today every single person is curious to earn money as much as they can and the interesting part is that this curiosity is increasing day by day so is their income. So now almost 80 percent people can afford their own transport. As people feel comfortable in there own vehicle. \n\nThe main advantage of having your own transport is that you do not have to wait for the public transport, you can save your time as you only need to accelerate your own transport and drive to your destination. \n\nPublic Transport is slow now, even though they are very comfortable but unfortunately people feel public transport is for poor people and if any middle class or upper class would travel through public transport it would affect his respect.\n\nBut still there are so many people who use public transport frequently but that is only their compulsion and poverty. When they would be financially stable they would surely buy their own vehicle.\nSo in my opinion I agree with the statement that there is no future of public transport.",

Hope my thoughts will be interesting for you.\n As for my personal experience of sports, I don't do it professionally. My future job won't be connected with it. So sport is my hobby, a nice method of having a rest, spending some new unusual life.\n Most of all I enjoy playing volleyball and badminton. There was a such time when I was visiting volleyball club, but I gave it up.I don't know why exactly. Maybe I hadn't enough time. Badminton is what I consider to be favorite. It's easy, interesting and funny. You can train your hands, reaction and legs, because it needs much run. Usually I do this kind of sports with my sister. We have a great time. Moreover, I like to do different physical exercises every morning. It makes my day more productive. When it's a good weather, I enjoy jogging near the house. How could I forget about cycling? To my mind, bike is the best way of traveling. It's also useful for cardiovascular system.\n I'm absolutely convinced, everyone should realize that the most important is health and sport really can help. If you want to keep your body in a good form, you ought to go in for it. If your figure is nice, you will have a nice mood, wonderful feelings. So it's better to choose sport instead computer in order to relax, feel positive emotions.\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Dear Sir/Madam,\nI am writing this letter because I am concerned about facilities for shoppers in our area. \nFirst of all, I have to admit I am addicted to shopping and I really like that there is such an extensive shopping area in our town. I appreciate also that it is located near to the housing estate. \nUnfortunately, I think there are some aspects that demand improvements. In my opinion parking charges are too high. Furthermore, the shopping area lacks restaurants and entertainment facilities. People usually become hungry after shopping, so opening eating places in this area would be very beneficial.  In addition, the shops arrangement is actually very messy and finding the store I need is hard.\nI would like to propose some solutions, as well. The parking should be free of charges, it would attract more people and increase the income overall. Moreover, you should change the arrangement of shops and divide the whole area to certain sections (e.g. clothes, food, and house).  Finally, opening restaurants with different types of food and entertainment facilities like movie theatres and gyms should be considered. \nYours faithfully,\nXYZ",

  "text": "My favourite sport is undoubtedly jogging.\nI am very lucky because not far from my home there are three parks so I can practise this sport whenever I want.\nUsually I jog three days a week and, honestly, I couldn't do without!\nRunning in contact with nature allows me to relax after work and recharge my energies. Once finished my training, I go home, take a shower and...I feel like a new woman!!\nMy advice for those people who want to take up this sport is to start gradually. They can begin to jog for 15 minutes and then increasing the time so that their body can get used to the muscular effort. Furthermore,it would be useful having a chronometer to check out your improvement.\nI would also recommend to stretch after every work out to avoid any kind of muscular pain. If you prefer, you can substitute stretching with few yoga exercises as well.\nGood jogging!!",

  "text": "Among young people exist a statement that shopping is always an enjoyable way to spend your free time. Personally I am not completely agree with this way of thinking.\nOn the one hand, if you have money and a lot of free time you can spend all day dodging in the mall for only one, special kind of skirt or pair of jeans. But if you do not have money, prices can only destroy your day because you know that you can not afford it. The prices in the shops often are very high and clothes are not good qualitatively. And when you want to buy something in lower price, you need to go to the mall when there are seasonal sales. But then everybody goes crazy, you need to crowd through the mob, argue with another person for one, special pair of shoes in your size. For me it is only a torture. Also you can be robbed because in crowded places you can easily fall prey to pickpockets. Otherwise you need to have time to walk through all the shops and find what you need, every thing on the rack is calling for your attention, after a while you want to buy everything.\nOn the other hand if you find a real bargain and buy something in very low price, you will be happy and content for the rest of the day. But in my case, it happen rarely. Some people do not want to buy things by network because they want to try on for example clothes. For me it is not necessary because every seller gives the size of his product and then I can check if this thing will be good for me or not. Also you can always return it like in the stationery stores.\nSumming I prefer doing my shopping by means of websides or auction portals. There I can easily find what interests me, what is in my size etc. For me it is easier and faster way to buy what I want, often in better price.",

If you don't know how to kick or blow, ask  your shifu (teacher) and keep doing it until you get it.\n\nPractice\nPractice makes better, do research about Muai Thai's culture, do research about Muai Thai's methods.

For the population density is ever-increasing currently, the loss triggered by these disasters are damaging and unaffordable for any single family.\nIn a response to address these side affects that the civilization bring about, governments must take measures stey by step to tackle them. Firstly, governing authorities should set up protect area for animals and plants, inhibitating hunting or even leisure activities like hiking. Apart from the natural areas, the minimual areas for forests and wetland have to be ensured. Secondly, government must fund environmental organizations, in order to manipulate and coordinate more power to stop the illegal hunting, deforesting and animal extinctions.

  "text": "Nowadays the type of transport that you use is a concerning matter of discussion. Public transport include buses, trains, and subway, however cars, bicycles, taxis are not forgotten. In the moment of choosing, very different aspects like ecological effects, the economic viability and even time uses, take part on the decision.\n\nFirstly, the car option is the best one in comfort, because you do not depend on a specific time to travel and modern cars have the best technology in equipment and facilities. Then public transport is not as comfortable as the previous one, because luckily you can find a place to sit and forget it if it is in the rush hour. \n\nBy the other hand, traffic is the biggest trouble talking about transport, cars facilities are replaced by the need of punctuality and, depending on the city, the delays are a concerning point when we talk about travelling by bus or trains. However, the economic aspect is very important to consider when we talk about convenience, cars are the most expensive ones. Not only because of the oil'prices, but also the costs of enssurance, the car, the parking taxes, etc. In comparisson with a bus ticket that costs four pesos and you are sure that sooner or later it will come. \n\nTo sum-up, neither cars nor public transport is considered the perfect option, but considering long term consequences as is nowadays common in some European countries, bicycles are the best way. Riding a bicycle reduces traffic, costs, ecological impact, and even car crushes. So, what are you waiting to buy a bicycle and put  a helmet on?",

Many people think that the first impression we give and our appearance are very important in our life; but, it should be like this?\n\n   It is certainly true that people are very critic with the appearance. We have subjetive opinions; we normally judge because we have a preconception idea. We match clothes stile with a lifestyle and a personality. That is why appearance should not have consequences in our lives.\n\n   Most people would agree that fashion is something that takes part in our day to day. Normally, people choose clothes that famous wear or appear in the magazines. However, there are people who do not follow that, and they dress the most comfortable clothes for them or the style they like most.\n\n    I think that there are many different occasions, and each one requires a different type of clothes. For example, in work interwies and work that have a direct contact with the public it is better to use a for or smart style. And same happened with parties, festivals, sports and other events.\n\n   Overall, my personal opinión is that we give so much importance to the clothes and the appearance than it should be. Although in some occasions some clothes styles are required, people should have freedom to choose what clothesdo they want to wear, and it should not have consequences in our life.",

Sarah yelled loudly for help, but Stephan didn’t notice and hear that so he kept on walking and listening to his music. Fortunately, there was a mother with her child strolling behind them, and saw Sarah got hurt. They took her to the hospital. Stephan still listening to the music and crossing the street. But he didn’t aware that the traffic light has turned red so the car couldn’t go through. The man in the car was very annoyed and pushed the horn seriously, but Stephan didn’t hear that. The man got down the car to tell Stephan stop listening to the music and pay attention with things around him. Not until that Stephan found that Sarah was lost did he call Sarah. And he knew that Sarah was in the hospital. Stephan went to the hospital immediately to see how Sarah was. Luckily Sarah was fine due to the woman who was walking behind them had called the ambulance at once. Stephan was glad that Sarah was alright and also thankful to the woman. After these incidents, not only Sarah but also Stephan realized how dangerous it was when you focused on technological products instead of the things around.

  "text": "An increasing number of people begin to discuss for the success in school or work, the having an ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances is more important than having excellent knowledge or a field of study. Many people air their opinions based on their own value system. The majority of people tend to claim that having an excellent knowledge or the research field is the most important for school or work successfully. However does the claim really ring true, conforming the real situation? I find myself not on the same wavelength with such an idea. It is my contention that the people, who have the ability to adapt or adjust conditions or circumstances have higher percentage be successful in school or work. \nAs far as I concern, there are a bunch of reasons to support me perspective. To begin with, acquiring the knowledge in today’s world is not a difficult things than it was in the past. That is to say, the investment of the internet make it available for everyone in the world. People can easily obtain the lasted knowledge by owning a computer that can access to the network and have the ability to reading. In other words, the way to get the knowledge is equal to everyone in the world. That is why it is not to be the key point that considered the key to success. In addition, the education has already across the wealth gap. To explain, there are a trend that many universities all over the world setting up the freely courses for the people who thirsty for knowledge, also often invited the famous scholar to give a speech to the public that is welcome for everyone. People in modern society have a lot of resources to further research the field of study that they are interesting in. Thus, everyone might be an expert. Excellent performance in the field of study has not been determined of factors for your success. \nA case in point would be the latest news broadcasted recently. According to the investigation conducted by the 104 human resource bank, the percentage of people using the knowledge in the work field that they from school has surprising reduced in the last two decades by roughly thirty percent, a figure that has nearly one half compared to that of half-century. Say it simply, the things that school teach us were no longer be used in the real world. This phenomenon had been curiously many experts. Does the knowledge from school have any different in the work field? However, after deeper analysis, we found that the very underlying contributing factor lies in the fast pace changing world and the text book cannot catch up with it, knowledge is changing from time to time. Hence, this research remained us that the ability to adapt or adjust to changing conditions or circumstances is the major factor to success instead of having excellent knowledge or a field of study. \nIn sum, there may be some people who may disagree with my position on this matter. They may say that having excellent knowledge or a field of study is the way to success in school or work. However, I think the reasons I have provided in favor of my view point are stronger.\n",

  "text": "In this essay, I will discuss whether older or younger parents are better. Nowadays, the statistics show that many people are younger than generations before.\n\nI think there are more younger parents because they do not live in a religious life which is far more stricter. Previously, the most women used to get a baby after the wedding with their partners, but today, it is not so important anymore. \n\nEvery child wishes to have young parents, but is it really better? Actually the teenagers are right because younger parents have a stronger relationship with their children. Apart from this the small difference between the ages is also an advantage. Although less experience is owned, they recognize what a child wants to do. On the other hand a disadvantage is that young parents are not able to protect their babies without having experience on that. \n\nIn my age young parents and I have in common that we go out in the evenings. From my point of view older parents can give better advice in every difficult situation. So the child grows up from a teenager to a middle-aged adult and can always looks up to the parents.\n\nHowever the progress in adolescence is important for the next stage of life so I believe both are good at bring up their children. To conclude, you can not change your parents anyway.\n",

  "text": "Everybody has got some ideas, how to live their own life. It is very important to think about possibilities that should create your fortune. There are two things that most impinge my life. \nFirst, it is my family that helps me to make a good decision. I live with my husband more than ten years, so we know each other quite well to support the other one. A big family is a great base for happy living together under one roof, but secrets are strongly forbidden. If somebody in my family ask me to help I need to know the whole true without any potential lies. That is why I learn my children to play fair. \nOn the other hand there is one other most important thing in my life- health. I am more than happy that I am healthy and my family members are healthy as well, because health is the rarest thing in the world. There is only one thing in the world that you can not buy and it is a health. It is well known true through the whole men that health is fair to the rich and poor equally.\nIn conclusion I have to think about one thing, which is more important in my life that the other one. I will always choose the health, because when a person is healthy he or she can do everything. ",

  "text": "There are some solutions to prevent the rise in the consumption of sugar sweetened drinks. The first solution is change portion size of soft drinks, which means smaller size of beverages could contain less sugar. National Nutrition Survey(1995) points out that the most consumption of beverages for a teenager per day is sugar sweetened soft drinks. Therefore, changing portion size of soft drinks would be efficient to reduce sugar intake for teenagers each time. The limitation of this solution is the public may not satisfied with this size of soft drinks. To overcome it, the producer of soft drinks could take a investment to teenagers what size is suitable before changing it. This would help the teenagers who drink soft beverage decrease sugar intake efficiently.\nAnother solution to this problem would be education. Family education would be introduced to their kids. National Nutrition Survey(1995) reports that teenagers are main soft drinks consumers and the most consumption of beverage is sugar sweetened drinks. Parents` words is key to restrict their kids` actions. If parents educate their children to keep away from soft drinks or cultivate the awareness of drinking water. They would not consume such amount of beverages. However, children my get soft drinks outside the family. That requires parents building a model to show positive effect without soft drinks. Therefore, their kids would follow parents` habits and behaviors.\nIn conclusion, increasing the consumption of soft drinks is one of issues to prevent from obesity and overweight. A number of strategies could be efficient to address these problems. Teenagers are main target who drink too many soft drinks. So that parents education and changing portion size could be useful to address the problems which happens around teenagers. If we take these measures within a short period and keep it for a long time, obesity and overweight problem would not happen in our next generations.",

  "text": "No future for public transport?\n\nCan use of your own car instead of a public transport save you money, time and effort? The most people prefer a car rather than a public transport. However the latest studies shows a car is not always more efficient.\n\nThe right choice of means of transport makes a big impact on your time and resources. In deciding whether to choose car or public transport we need to consider many factors, such as length of journey, time of the day we travel, area we travel through, number of us, weather etc. As there are cases where car is much more efficient than public transport and other way round.\n\nThe recent studies found, that travelling from a suburb to the city centre is much more efficient by combining a bike with a train. It saves plenty of time by avoiding traffic jams and there is no need for searching for a parking space. In addition travelling by train saves a great deal of money as there is no parking fee. Moreover there are discounts for regular journeys.\n\nOn the other hand, the studies showed, in many other cases and especially in irregular trips there is more convenient to use a car. A car is unbeatable for its flexibility. It is much more easy to use a car when going shopping, or making a leisure or an occasional trips. Although, there are some disadvantages of using a car such as traffic jams and a high maintenance cost.\n\nAll in all, in most cases using your own car can save you money, time and effort. Popularity of cars confirms it. In spite of that, studies said there are cases in which public transport is unbeatable. Therefore it has a safe place in our society.",

  "text": "The use of public transport has become an important issue nowadays. There are those who try to avoid the use of public transport and prefer driving their own car due to the advantages it offers. However there are those who reject this and are in favour of the use of public transport. I am going to explain why I think there is not future for the public transport.\n\nA great amount of people think that driving your own car has more benefits than using public transport. Firstly, it allows you to go directly somewhere without finding out the information about the timetables of public transport such as buses or trains. In addition, sometimes you have to combine both of them in order to arrive on time to your work place.\n\nAnother benefit of not using public transport is the time you can save. For instance, if you have to go another city by bus or train to your workplace, the time you waste since you set off increases. Saving time in the mornings allows you to sleep more or to spend more time with your family.\n\nMoreover, the use of your own car has more advantages. Travelling by car avoids getting wet when the weather is rainy. If you travelled by bus or train, probably you would spend more time walking along the streets to your final destination. Despite the bad weather, if you travellled by car, you could park your car near your destination, so that you could arrive comfortably.\n\nHowever, there is some people who prefer the use of public transport in spite of using the car. The government usually advise the population to use public transport to cut down pollution and the amount of gases which damage the atmosphere. In addition, it is often claimed that is cheaper than travelling by car. Although it has some benefits, in most part of the country, especially in the smallest towns the public transport is not enough developed.\n\nTo sum up, I believe that the public transport has no future because it makes you to waste a lot of time, it is not enough developed in small areas and there is not enough frequency of trains and buses. In my opinion it could be useful hardly ever times, so it would be necessary a great amount of improvements.\n",

  "text": ".H. Lawrence’s saying „Nobody ought to own houses or furniture – any more than they own the stones of the high road” is an ambiguous saying that questions the need of the people regarding a high number of properties.\nFirst of all, to a certain degree, I comply with the idea of controlling the maximum number of properties one holds in his grasp, because this denies the possibility of exhausting the spaces that can hold another family. This speaks of the idea of the government or another organization having the control over houses and their furniture and making the people living there only the owners of their own goods. This is an interesting concept because it can give the government the money it needs to solve its other problems and doesn’t necessarily break any rule of personal space.\nSecond of all, as I did say “to a certain degree”, the idea of controlling one’s own choices regarding house picking and what they can do with them takes away a bit of their freedom, which is the complete opposite of what we should get to. Mankind has always strived for freedom in one way or another, and taking away the control of their own house, their sanctuary, will not be taken lightly by them.\nIn conclusion, I cannot tell whether or not the control of the people’s houses and furniture will bring any help in today’s society, as we are only hypothetically speaking, without any form of testing, however it does have its strong and weak points.",

My advice for people that is going to start football is that you just have to do your best. And try to be a part of the team, then it's more fun. And when a football training goes bad, you don't have to complain so much about it. Just keep going and try to do it again. Of course you can be angry but it's not a big deal.

In my point of view it is a good situation because the children can do different after school activities without moving too much. Moreover, for the parents is easier.\n I want to emphasize that thanks to his full schedule and amount of the coaches, adults like children  can do different activities at the same time instead to have to wait.\n\nOn the other hand, the only disadvantage I can see is there aren't activities for the old people. This centre should provide activities that do not require much physical effort for this kind of people like petanque or something like that.\nFinally to say that is a perfect sports centre and inexpensive including a range of activities.",

We spent a huge period of time together. Thomas is looking for a thrilling job. David is in a boarding school in Bern and conclude next summer.\n\nThomas is a small and fine fellow. He is one of the most persevering people I know. David looks bored at the first moment but in fact he is wetty. His body is large and thick like an elephant.\n\nDavid is always ready for a joke but amazinly that he has the ability to appear seriously.

Only a few long seconds spent thinking about what he had to do: he had to save the passengers. He desperately run through the train towards the driver. He tried to push the door that led to the head of the engine, but it was locked from the inside. A cold chill run along his neck. He was scared. He wanted to cry. Desperately he started to kick the door, furiously, blind with rage, harder, faster. The door opened. Then he saw the commander was lying dead in his chair. He was shot in his head. Fortunately, a voice from the radio was trying to contact the man. In a hurry he dashed to the microphone and answered the control station. \"Where are the brakes?\"  Now in the distance he could see the first skylines of the city. The train was finally stopped. That day he came a hero. He saved 220 people and among them he knew the girl that 5 years later became his wife.",

The most important thing that ya person should know about this game is that a lot of intelligence is requested because you must know how to reach  how to get nearer to make their aim become reality, and that one is that the team should score as much as they can to win the match and have fun.\n\n  In my opinion this sport will always be my favourite because it made me feel happy and have a great time with my friends,and it also maintained me in good shape.

Bachelor's paper [1] is one of the good sources of describing what does research mean. He mentioned about an important point for doing a good research. First of all, researchers should be interested in what they are doing. Interesting in the area of research leads to invent and optimize ideas that are already existing. Second, critical thinking which is the deep thinking about the problem and the way to solve it, is an important factor of successful research. Also, honesty, originality which is the ability to think critically, independent and creative, and precision let research to be more valuable. Moreover, working as a team for researching, let researchers gain lots of research benefits. Such as, ideas and learning more the best methods to analyze data. All members of the team will get benefits and push each other to achieve the goal by giving some advice and more information. In addition, Clear, easy to understand, and precise scientific paper are one way to represent, share, and discuss the ideas and results with others in a scientific environment. Also, Seminars are other good sources to come up and listen to a new idea. Exchange information with other researchers, via scientific papers or seminars, sometimes come up with solutions for other researches' problems. Researchers should not give up when face hard problem with the research and keep try by different ways to solve it and they will do it at the end. To conclude, there are some of an important research principles. Whenever researchers consider most or all of them when working on the research, researchers will get results with a high precision. Researchers enjoy their research as an enjoyable activity.",

For example, if I travel to my company by bus, I must be on time and follow the bus schedule. Sometimes, bus schedule does not suitable for me. Maybe, bus comes too early or too late for me to go to work. Traveling by car, I can choose the time. Moreover, I can choose my own route to go to work. I can stop at my favorite coffee shop to buy drinks for breakfast.\nSecond, I feel comfortable when I travel by my own car. I hate to travel by public transport because it is sometimes too crowded and noisy. In rush hours, I do not have a seat and I stand all the time for a half hours. In my own car, I can relax with music and enjoy fresh air. Furthermore, I do not worry about the theft or any crime which used to happen when I traveled by train.\nGenerally, although traveling by public transport is cheaper than by car.

They turned out to be such a wonderful people, they treated me like an old friend, making jokes all the time and even invited me to eat dinner with them.\nOn the day of the concert, I met band two hours before start, I ironed all clothes, I even do girls hairstyle.\nWhen the concert hall was full, band came on the stage. In the headlights, they all looked so beautiful! I felt like that was partly my doing. I was part of the team. That was what I particularly liked about that experience!\nI was dancing and singing all show, and after manager came to me and asked if I would like to work with them full time.\nI will have to sleep on it. What do you think I should do? And how was your weekend? Hope to see you soon!\nWith love,\nMaria",

So do other people in my country, especially old people who have not got their own cars. I catch buses regularly and see a lot of people there. You can imagine how great is idea to leave your own car and take a bus to go to work or go shopping. Another good idea is to use bicycles. I'm glad that every year we have such a wonderful day called \"A day without cars\" or something like that when people try to use public transport rather that their own cars.

I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write, but I have been working my fingers to the bone preparing for my exams, for which I'm annoyingly nervous.\nSpeaking of nervousness, I think I've found a solution for you to shake off your nerves about using the English tenses correctly. You wrote that this sometimes made you stutter during tours, which made you feel rather uncertain. However, there's no need to worry any longer, if you have a look at www.elihinkel.org/tips/tenses.htm. At this website, you can find a clear, detailed explanation of the tenses, with illuminating animations. \nI got to leave off now, I'm afraid. Hopefully you're able to visit the site. I'm sure that if you spend some time studying the information you can find there, you'll have mastered the tenses the next time we see each other. \nKeep me posted on your experiences in the jungle!\n\nLove,\n\nSuzanne",

Entering your car and giving the directions and then having a stress-free drive towards your destination and let a computer take control of your ride is not a distant dream anymore. But are driverless cars as safe as old fashion cars? \n\nIt is surely a fact that autopilots in car´s sure are handy. It takes hours driving to and from, hours where one just have to concentrate on driving, hours gone futile. Although it must be admitted that driverless vehicles are expected to help children, the blind, the elderly and others who currently cannot safely drive themselves. On the other hand it will lead to more driving, because smarter driving reduces the cost per mile of vehicle usage. The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption. \nTo put the whole matter in a nutshell the self-driving system is good to prevent accidents.\nHowever you should still be able to drive by yourself you can not only rely on that system it is still not free from errors.\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Hi Jay!\nYou're right,in fact it was very difficult to me but I finally took this decision because I want to make new experiences.I'm very excited!I'm going to the United Kingdom in a week's time but I've already made some plans about it.\n\nFirst of all I'd love to visit new places.Would you mind making a list of places you like the most?. Moreover I need to organise a tandem to improve my English but if it wouldn't work I could attend an English course. Do you know any languages school?They're very expensive so I will need more money.\n\nSpeaking about money...I really need to find a job! I have to get money if I want to stay there for half a year! And my parents refused to give it to me because they say I must become indipendent.Will I succeed? Who knows...In the meantime what about helping me to find a part-time job? I can't definitely get a full-time job 'cause I want to relax and have fun.\nText me if you find something for me.\nBest wishes.\nEleonora.",

I think that everybody should visit it because you can see beautiful paintings of gifted and famous artists.\nIt's a great idea to go hiking with your family. When and where are you going hiking? Have you bought any equipment yet? Did you go hiking last year? \nHope to hear from you soon.\nBest wishes,\nInna",

  "text": "The Vietnamese education and study system is completely different from the Australian one. Like to Asia countries, such as: Korea, China, Singapore, the Vietnamese education and study system is really harsh and highly competitive to all students, especially for the primary students. \nFirstly, the primary education and study system of Vietnam is very hard. They have to study a lot with from 5 – 6 subjects in a semester. These subjects mainly focus on math skills, grammar, writing, but there are not any courses related to life and communication skills or innovative science. All subjects are less flexible and all students are learning the same programs at the same time. Meanwhile, the Australian education and study system is easier and more enjoyable than Vietnamese system. In a class, there are very few students with many more flexible study programs. The primary students are touch many different life skills by teachers at school. Additionally, the subjects in the school are given with the aim to develop thinking and creativity of students. They also play many interesting sports. \nSecondly, it is not only from the school but also Vietnamese parents of the primary students are also expected in the education of their children. They usually hope that their children get on the highest scores in school. Therefore, outside the school, Vietnamese parents want to send their children to tutorial classes, such as: math, writing, grammar, …. Consequently, Vietnamese children have not any life skills and have many health problems, such as: short-sighted, tummy-ache, spinal column… Sadly, the proportion of Vietnamese children who are short-sighted tend to increase in recent years. Meanwhile, Australian parents also care about their children but other way with Vietnamese parents. Outside the school, they send their kids to sport Centre or go to the social activities. \nSum up, Australian children are happier than Vietnamese children. I think that primary students need to spend more time for playing and enjoy their childhood.\n",

I like climbing because this sport makes me feel alive, even sometimes I feel fear. But don't think that climbing is a dangerous activity!. Although you climb to the top of a rock wall, you always do it with a checked security material. \nFirstly, if you want to climb you will need, at least, a partner. You must rely your life on this person, so it's important you get on with him or her. It is perhaps for this reason that people who climb are often couples! Moreover, climbing is a sport in which it's not too important if you are a man or a woman because you doesn't only use your strength but also your equilibration. \nYou should give a try to this amusing and thrilling sport that it's a sort of competition with yourself: every day a little bit higher, every day a little bit difficult.. If you take up climbing, I'm sure you'll carry on!!",

Grandma's food is great and I spend days staying outside, playing badminton or volleyball or having a walk in the wood. Some days we have a long trip too. We bring food and drinks and we spend a day in beautiful places such as the top of a montain, an amazing castle or a tipical market of a town. But what I love best are the afternoons with my favourite cousin, Sara, and his brother, Luke. We play Risiko fou hour: we're never fed up! In winter is even better: there's a lot of snow and we often go skiing on the near peaks: skiing is my favourite sport, I do that since I was five and I love doing the most difficult slops, and Christmas is beautiful with the people I love best. These are some reasons of why I love mountains and why I spend there most of my holiday. we were in cold",

It was so exciting and funny listenig to all those musicians, because some of them actually didn't have the skills to play and didn't have the charm needed to warm up the people.\nIn the end all went fantastic.

In villages the only way of public transportation is small buses, most of which can service up to twenty passengers in any moment of time.\nIn regional centers most people commute via trolleybuses and tramcars. The latest is transport of choice of most people because its passengers very rarely lose time in traffic jams due to dedicated railway passages. \n\nThose who are not satisfied with public transportation system may use private vehicles. I estimate more then 99 percent of them are cars. Rarely we can see bicycles and scooters. \n\nI used to travel on buses. But recently I bought a cheap bike and really enjoyed riding in summer time. Now, in November, weather in Russia is not so good so I switched back to buses. \n\nMy most recent dream is to ride on EuroVelo roads network.

I'm doing it since I'm six years old. It is so fascinating for me to build up a relationship to the horse you ride. You know what is the most important thing about riding horses?\n\nIt is all about trust. If you provide confidence, the horse will trust you. With this reliance you can go throughout everything together. \n\nMany people think, it's not really a sport. But believe me, riding uses so much endurance!\nWhat I like mostly about all the different sections of riding horses is jumping. I feel so free when I can fly over these obstacles. Another good feeling is the speed when you gallop.\n\nSurely this was not everything. Riding means also to clean the horse and look after it, but nevermind, it's the best sport you can do. ",

  "text": "As the production of cars is increased, it seems that the needs for public transportation is declined. Some insist that no one need bus or subway in the future. However, in my opinion, it rather useful to use public vehicles as time goes by based on two critical reasons. \nFirst, people don't want to waste their time finding parking lots. The more people have their own cars, the more space to park is needed. Unfortunately, there is a certain limit to space, so it is not possible that everyone use their car every day especially in mega cities like Seoul, New York, and London. It is more convenient to move from here to there when you take the bus or subway because you don't have to worry about your car while working. \nThe second reason is more important and obvious. It is related to the environmental issues. Using public means help to protect the Earth from air pollution. There are so many kinds of problems which the environmental pollution causes. The pollution is a kind of global issues of which people should consider seriously. Without reducing personal vehicles, there is no solution of that problem. Surely, the government will try to make a better system of public transport because they want citizens not to use their own means. \nFor these reasons, there will be the future for the public transport always. Moreover, it is quite optimistic that people will need more it rather than private transport.  ",

  "text": "This topic leads me to think of professional skill \"Architecture design\". This result in different of views on whether people agree the best things for improvement people's lives have already taken place. I hold the belief that the topic for me is completely wrong, even some improvements are easy to use and solves the most of problems.\n\nFirst, the development of population still continue, the space for living still a serious problem although, the skyscraper already solved the most of problems from population crisis. On the other hand, the skyscraper makes more problems, such as pollution. For example, I designed the highly architecture in the highly population density city in Taiwan. The skyscraper provides more space for excess population; however, the building will produces more pollution when the skyscraper constructs by modern materials, such as steel and concrete. They will destroy the environment when the raw material digs out from the site. The pollution must hurt the local people and environment from the site of raw materials. This is why I mentioned that the problem still exists and the problem only transforms to another regions and type.\n\nSecond, the computer system looks like solves the most of problems; however, this system make more dangerous in specific situations. The \"BUG\" must be appears from man-made system because of the incomplete coding. That is why our personal information always leaks to the \"hacker\". For instance, when we enjoy the electronic commercial service and shop the goods on the Internet, the hacker may steal the private information at the same time. They will use that information to cheat people’s money on the phone and you will trust them because of the correct personal information. This is normal phenomenon in Taiwan; however, police can’t do anything because of the hacker's anonymity. That is what I said that the best improvement things still not exist, even the computer system already solved some problems.\n\nOf course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue. That being said, I still feel the reasons I have presented was strong ones, such as architecture and computer system.\n",

  "text": "Dear Jane,\n\nAs soon as I read the article about your problem,I decided to write you at once and give you some suggestions,since I have the similar interest in physical fitness,too.I feel very strongly that the daily exercise is a basic definition which we must keep if we want to be on shape.\nTo start with,a simple way to work out is not to get the bus for school.For example,you could go on foot or with  your bicycle accompanied by your friends instead.by doing this,you will burn more and more calories daily without a special equipment and having fun with your pals.\nFurthermore,if I were you, I would go with engaging in healh club.For instance,signing up  for hip-hop dance or aerobic classes as I do , it would be a nice idea.In this way, you will do a hard-working exercise without realising it,as you will enjoy yourself at the same time.\nWhat is more,it could help if you work out at home and buy gym equipment such as treadmill or a bicycle.By doing the chores of the house like the washing is another way to exercise as well.As a result, you will save time and embarrassment,especially if you are out of shape.\nTo sum up,if you follow my options you'll see results directly and I'm sure you will not regret it.You will not feel self-confident and glad ,but your outward appearance wiil be better.",

Talking is truly the unique way to get to know people and establish strong bound.\nMoreover, some guys try to find friends who always agree with them. However, it could be a little bit unhealthy.

  "text": "Money: essential for youngsters?\n\nAt the age of eighteen, most of British students are finishing secondary school. A new, tougher world is in front of them as they get ready for collage or to embark on their professional career. The family financial support, at this stage, seems almost essential. With this in mind, some questions arise: Should young people be given all money easily or should they put in a great deal of effort to get it? Should parents prepare the ground for their sons' success or just let them work hard to build their lives?\n\nWe have to admit that toil and trouble are urgent needs of this juvenile generation. Why do we call them youngsters? Because they are so, and there is no trouble with that. But there comes a time when they are supposed to make it to adulthood. At this point, lack of money might be a blessing in disguise. The more they sweat to chase their dreams, the fast they ripen and prize what they earn.\n\nI'm not dismissing the idea of financial aid, though. Don't get me wrong, please. What I'm doing is challenging the way we approach to it. We have to preserve the ethical value of maintenance at the same time we help the next generations to succeed by their own means. If we can provide youngsters with money and still avoid they grow lazy, then economic relief is welcomed.\n\nUndoubtedly, I'm presenting a major challenge to every parent: shall we be able to take care for youngsters provision and yet teach them that money doesn't grow on trees? Money is almost essential, but the way young people learn to interact with this is essential to shape a society that appreciates what it obtains through effort.\n",

I arrived very exahusted, because I could’t sleep the night before. I had to wait awake in the airport! \nWhen I arrived at home ,I just wondered one thing, sleep, so I did. I was sleeping all the afternoon. I was really tired ! \nMonday, I had the typical “family day”, I had been eating with all my family in our cottage. Then I met with my friends and we had a nice evening drinking some beers in the pubs. \nThe Tuesday was an extraordinary beach day. I was all the day liying in the beach, talking with my friends  and having an incredibly time with them. \nWednesday was the relaxed day. I was all the day at home with my cat watching English film and eating Spanish desert. \nIn Andalusia, in Easter, the typical desert it’s called “pestiño” . It a sweet olive oil pastry with honey.  My mum was preparing the day before, and was really yummy. I almost eat it all! \nMy family is catholic so in Easter, the main days for our religion are Thursday and Friday , for my family too. \nI’m catholic, I believe in God but I’m not very friendly with the Vaticano’s rules. I’m a free catholic. Probably it sounds weird, but I’m on my way. \nThese two day were family days, I had to go to the church to a mess which represent the last alive days from Jesuschrist: the last dinner and the passion. \nAt least, these weekend  I didn’t do anything in special, because I feel tired and I hadn’t got money enough to do any special plan. \nFinally, the day to comes to England had arrived.Monday I came back to London and my holidays had finished. \nSee you soon Spain !\n",

  "text": "In my opinion public transport is the future, because its quality and comfort will improve and it'll be easier to move and cheaper too.\n\nTravelling by car is so much more conveniente if we think about small places such as villages or small towns.Imagine to go by car to cities like London, is it the car more convenient? If you consider the cahotic traffic and the long queues to get there and impact of these factores on people's health and people's finances, I'm sure you'll change your mind about public transport.\n\nIn the last few years public transport has been improving a lot in terms of technology, flexibility and diversity in terms of timetables, tickets and places. Besides these, the public transport is better for the environment, especially the electric bus.\n\nThe electric bus is an option in many countries as a way to improve the environment. This type of transport is a great contribution to the environment, because it's cleaner than those that need petrol or diesel to work.On the other hand, is possible to find hibrid cars but they are more expensive than those that works with normal fuel and for that reason people's first option is not this kind of car.\n\nThe theme of environment is very important nowadays and can cost a lot to a country. A country has to pay for their ecological foot and this means as much pollution is produced more environment damage, in other words bigger ecological foot, and consequently more has to be paid.\n\nGovernments will define environmental stategies in order to decrease the costs of ecological foot. Such strategies will involve taxes above poluent cars, the increase of fuel price and definition of benefits to those who opts for more environmental means of transport.\n\nSo the convenience of travelling by car is not totally true. \n\nOf course you are owner of your time and destinations, but it is enough? Think about its impact on your espences and on the environment, wouldn't be better to take a bus, an underground or a train? \n\nIf we consider all the factors mentioned above, probably much people will change their mind.

  "text": "A wise man said \"The pen is mightier than the sword\" (Edward Bulwer-Lytton). These words reflect the power and the importance of writing and reading across mankind’s history. Although there are a lot of reasons that support that idea, this article focuses about the importance of reading as a great tool to exercise our brain.\nFirst of all, the brain is a complex part of our body that is able to process information and create knowledge based on stimulus. Those kinds of stimulus come from several sources and they help you in different measures to exercise the brain. However, reading is the most important source to exercise the brain because it presents a lot of challenges for our mind. For instance, when you read, you have to associate characters and places, and memorize details. Those kinds of things help to the brain to be more active and process information faster.\nAt second, there are some researches that prove that in general people who read are smarter than people who do not. This affirmation is based in the fact of the increase of literacy and development of verbal intelligence that people get when they exercise the brain reading books. This is another big reason to take care about reading, because in this competitive world, only smart people will be able to get the best opportunities available in society.\nAt third, when people read, they have to use the imagination to get a better idea of what’s going on. That situation is another example of how reading is an excellent brain’s exercise, because when people have to imagine things, the brain has to be creative, and that kind of process is too important to improve yourself in problem’s resolution and creation of important ideas in real life.\nIn general all the things described before show how important is reading to exercise the brain. So, next time when you try to avoid a book, think first whether you need that your brain works faster or be more creative, because could be a good idea to exercise a little bit your brain with reading.\n",

  "text": "Review Silence of the Lambs\n\nThere are many good movies, especially thrillers are always enjoyable in my opinion. One of those is the movie ‘Silence of the Lambs’, where Clarice, an FBI agent in training, has been asked to talk to an imprisoned Hannibal Lecter who has information about a serial killer the FBI has been trying to catch.\n \nThere were several reasons why this movie stood out. First I was really impressed by the performance of Jodi Foster (Clarice) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal). I have always thought of them as really good actors, but they were exquisite in this movie. Not only in their individual parts, but also in the scenes they did together. Secondly, the storyline was unpredictable and really clever and for that really enjoyable. You had to pay attention throughout the entire movie to keep up with the story. On top of that was there tension at all times.\n\nThis movie is outstanding, I believe that even people who are not really into thrillers will enjoy watching it. As I mentioned before, are both the acting and the storyline really impressive. You will be watching with full interest. At last is the character of Hannibal Lecter one of a kind, there is no other movie where you will find a figure like him.\n",

  "text": "Dearest Renee,\n\nHow’s your first English literature lesson at school? I hope it had loads of fun with plenty new knowledge acquired! I had learnt the special features of the 16th century acting business and theatres in London as well as the lifetime of William Shakespeare. I can’t wait to tell you more!\n\nYou may have thought theatres would be fashionable place for the royalty, courtiers and merchants. However, it was not. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I, play watching was an entertainment for the locals to relax. As it cost very little to get into an open-aired theatre, everyone jammed and jostled to watch plays, though the poor stood under bright sunshine and had their heads burnt while the rich sat in the shelter with an extra shilling paid.\n\nAt the same time, actors were busy dressing and reciting the scripts. ‘Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs.’ Do you remember this famous quote from Romeo and Juliet? At that time, males had to work while the female were forced to stay at home and do all the household chores. Frankly speaking, actresses did NOT exist! These actors paid full attention to convenience the audience that it was graceful Juliet rather than a stiff boy acting. They used props, thick make-up, gowns, wigs and all sorts of accessories. The ‘Juliets’ even had to shave their beard and moustache and enjoy their role throughout the play. What a gargantuan sacrifice of self-esteem and reputation they had given up! One more interesting fact is that, both the lovers in the play were Italians but their playwright had never been to Italy. It could reflect 16th century London was a melting point of different cultures and Shakespeare probably got in touch Italian culture by making friends with those local visitors.\n\nThree trumpet blasts were given symbolizing the start of play, yet none of the respected silence would be given. Audience would boo and throw fruits to the actors in case they didn’t like them. Special dramatic effects were thus added on stage. Cannonballs were rolled around to make sound of thunder. Pig’s blood was used during casualties or deaths in sword fighting. Stage trapdoors allowed actors to vanish magically. In a roofed-in theatre, pulleys and machinery were used for lowering actors on stage. Shakespeare provided everything the people asked for --- laughter, romance, and tragidies. The play lover, King James I was impressed and became the patron of the Lord Chamberlain’s Men. The company changed its name into ‘the King’s Men’ and performed over 200 plays!\n\nBy now, I have widened my horizons and increased my interest towards the spotlight on playhouses. I wish you love it either!\n\nWrite soon!\n\nCheers, \nMichelle\n",

  "text": "As you asked I am going to give the information of how my village looks after the environment. My village has been working on this project for decades they have been fixing their techniques and they still know a day´s everything has cost us a lot of effort we started from the easiest examples (dividing rubbish into different containers) to some that are more complex (renewable energy). We live in an area where its population has all types of animals which can get hurt very easily by human´s activities; so in our community we have very strict rules when referring to taking care of the environment. The principal things everyone must have at their houses are three trash can for the division of the trash; one must be for renewable materials (rest of food, paper, carton…) another for plastics and the last one for glass.  All the energy being used in the town is renewable energy; (hydraulic energy, solar energy and wind energy) every house has a solar panel that gets the sun light transforming it into energy, that provide part of the energy to each house the days that the sun shines but if there is no sun the village has a dam beside us which provides them enough with water for the whole village and also with hydraulic energy; not only we have hydraulic energy but also wind energy; in the out skirts of the village there is a wind power plant where the wind energy is produced. Also our water has one of the best purification methods after we use it we clean it so we don’t contaminate the water of the river or dam.To try to keep the environment clean we have a big group of voluntary workers that work after their jobs here trying to keep this area as clean as possible by picking all the rubbish and controlling the whole area in case there is something not normal.\nApart from this group of voluntaries every person of the village is obliged to take care of the environment and use the car as little as possible so the pollution is as minimum as possible here the bicycle is the most famous way of transport car aren’t common they are only used when transporting heavy thing or when travelling long distances.  \n",

Shops could give us even 70 percent of sale, what helps saving more money.\nOn the other hand, doing the shopping is not only something enjoyable. One of the drawback of going to the shop is that we spend huge amount of money. We would buy next, impracticable high-heel shoes, which will spend couple of years in wordrobe.

The physical exercise endured during cycling provides a great workout for the cycler, and in addition to that, blending with mother nature helps improve mental health; you also save your own money by not paying for oil bills.\n\nAnother way to help is to save the electricity, and while doing that, save my money too. Moreover, less electrical stress on the machines ensures that the machines' lives elongate.\n\nI also recycle my old paper material such as old books, and this greatly helps our atmosphere thanks to the decrease in hazardous gases resulting from burned waste. On the other hand, we all get to benefit from the cheaper recycled paper materials; I also want to mention the blissful feeling I get when I recall I have done good for our wonderful world.\n\nIn the end, I sincerely hope this report proves informative and encouraging for many.

It also had some warm scenes, showing hope, courage and sacrifice. \n\n\n            Before I moved to Canada. I did not know much about African-Americans' history. I had heard about slavery, discrimination, hate crimes against black people, but I did not know what really happened at that time. Now from books, movies, I knew some of the most influence movements, I know Martin Luther King, Jr. was more than an activist and a public speaking man. I knew the first person who ended the segregation at southern was a 9-year old girl. It's hard to imagine what they had been through during the civil rights movements. It's hard to put myself into their boat. What if I was an African- American, what if I was born during the segregation time. Would I be brave, determined? Would I hide behind crowds? I really don't know.\n\n\n          It is really difficult to even think of.  As if I cannot imagine if I were a heroin of one of the enormous heroic stories. What would I do for my county.

Every day, a lot of animals die due to all the rubbish we throw into the oceans.\nThe second thing I learnt was that we have to change the way of fishing because the fishermen kill a lot of aquatic animals, like dolphins or sea turtles, that they don’t want to kill. This is because they drag nets along the seabed and catch all the animals that are swimming in it.\nSo overall I would recommend this documentary to everybody because all the people must know what we are doing with the Earth and they must learn to look after it because we only have one Earth and if we destroy it, we won’t have any place where we can live.\n",

  "text": "Renée Kwakkenbos\n\nDear Bruce,\nThank you for your circular in which you explained your plans with the Warden Park. My husband and I appreciated very much that you are receptive to new ideas.  \nAs you know, we frequently visit your Health and Fitness Club. The swimming pool is the favourite spot for building our condition. Can you imagine that we were a bit disappointed when we read your plans to build a second sauna cabin beside the swimming bath?  I hope you consider the kids in this plan! For them (or do I have to admit us), it should be a better idea to build a changing room with more space at that particular place. \nIn addition, your proposal to provide additional equipment for the gym and a wide screen TV for the snack bar did not get applause in our home. The snack bar is our reward at the end of all our sweating, but I must apologize that sometimes we leave this place because of its long waiting times.  My recommend: do not hesitate to invest in a second microwave. My last, but not least, advice is  for the gym.  Maybe you can consider a bit renewing there with new classes, such as kickboxing. \nThank you once again that we were allowed to give our suggestions for you wonderful place. If you ever do need more of these proposals, you can reckon us!\nKind regards,\n",

Doors will open by our voice, footprint or retina scan. All appliances will be eco-friendly. There will not be a home without air-conditioning anymore. Room configuration and style will be somewhat different – more glazing, more open spaces. Homes in general will be more airy. The decor will be more modern and simpler.

I choose this man because he was  a significant player during the slave trade. He fought for the liberation of slavery in West Africa.    He put the Gambia on the world map. The Gambia is visited by many tourist because of him.  This has led to many black Americans to visit the Gambia for investment purposes. \n\n Kinta Kenneth was a captured slave from Naima Juffera. He was captured while hunting with his colleagues in the forest. This was in 1879 during the slave trade period. Kunta was captured because he was trying to rescue his friend who was lost in the forest. He can across the slave master in the mouth of the river Gambia while looking for his friend. He ran away from them but they later captured him with their dogs. \n\n Kunta was sold to slave master in South America. He works very had in the sugar plantation for the slave master.  While in capture, he fought the rights of all the black slaves in the campus. He refused to work more than eight hours a day and he refused to take orders from the slave master. He was refused with food but he kept going with his strike.\n\n He was later given the opportunity to learn English language. He attends the same class with other relatives of the slave masters. He did very well during their exam and was given another opportunity to teach English to other slaves. \n\nHe was famous and respectful in the slave Campus. But was later betrayed by his slave masters. He organised demonstrations which turned out to abolishment of slavery.  He died during the demonstration. But his name was written by all western nation newspaper as the brave man. Because of his efforts that lead to the abolishment of slavery and the freedom for captured slave in the campus.  \n\n\n  The Gambia is well known by the adventurers and the tourist.

In this era, there are many types of public transport using by people, for example: bus, train, monorail, light-rail-transit (LRT), taxi, and so on. \nMost people using a public transport to go to their workplace and travelling around the city. Some of the workers choosing to use public transport than their own cars. This is because they want to avoid the traffic block.  Mostly, they are more preferring to use public transport than the car because it can avoid the traffic block and save time to get into their workplace earlier. It is also can save the money as the price of the ticket of public transport is cheaper compared to oil cost by using the car.\nThrough all of these points, it is not faulty to say that is the public transport still available and very useful in our daily life, even there are a lot types of cars, which are more convenient. so, there will be a future for public transport because of its own benefits or advantages to human society. It is very friendly transportation where the people from all places, meet in one transport and they can make a relationship between them. Additionally, the pollution, such as haze, will be decreased because fewer people using the car.\nAs a conclusion, there is a future for public transport and it also convenient to use it for travelling.

The restaurant I would love to review for the class is one of the most popular restaurants located just near the downtown plaza. It is called the 'Egyptian Cuisine' and its name actually represents what it has to offer.\n\nIt offers a delicious Egyptian menu which provides enough dishes to cover all tastes, as an example, their delicious fresh eggplant traditional salad. If there is anything that favors this restaurant, it has to be the quantity they serve; a surely efficient quantity along the truly special quality leaves this restaurant as one of the best in town, if not in the whole country. \n\nWhat about the amazing eccentric atmosphere they have to offer; with a soulful live band and an elegant dining set, their atmosphere adds up to the flavor of their food. In addition to that, they will be able to offer a connected table that could fit ht whole class, professionally named, the meeting table.\n\nTo come to the point. This restaurant has to be the right choice for two reasons; firstly it offers a traditional menu which will ensure to cover all different tastes. Secondly, the lively atmosphere it offers will surely keep the class entertained during the entire dine-in.\n\nAt the end of my essay, I would like to devote this paragraph and thank my wonderful teacher for this opportunistic chance to offer my sincere opinion on the topic. Many thanks and I hope for a wonderful trip regardless of the restaurant voted for.",

It was not only the first class that I had to speak out in class. Although it was not easy to get used to such teaching style, it did not take long for me to realise what teachers were expecting from us and why they were doing so. Participation in class by asking and answering to questions demands more active thinking from us.\nNobody would argue the significance and effectiveness of modern technology, having revolutionised all spheres of human lives by providing a great number of remarkable virtues, such as massproduction, information and communication devices as well as medical and scientific breakthroughs.\nHowever, it has also posed some alarming issues, namely environmental destruction, and increasing unemployment and health concerns.\nThis essay will attempt to analyse both sides of this controversial phenomenon with some applicable supporting ideas.\nTo begin with, evidently, technological progress has noticeably enhanced individuals'quality of lives, controbuting to the economic growth of numerous nations.\nTo illustrate, machineries and the use of fertilisers in agriculture have helped to develop massproduction and raise the availability and quantity of various types of food, having made them cheaper and more affordable.",

  "text": "My favourite sport is a Tamil sport known as Kabadi.I believe many of us do not have a faintest idea about this sport.At the outset,let me tell you about this sport and how it is played.It is played in a box drawn on the ground in the size of a volleyball court.A centre line parts the box and a line is drawn inside each box about 2 feet from the line which ends the box,and this line is called proudly as Ellai kodu(Border Line)in Tamil.There will be 2 teams and each team consists of 6 players and the players assume the border line as their own border.This makes the game war-like and very special to Tamils.\n            Rules of engagement are quite simple.The first and most important rule is you do not let the opponent player who raids your field(the box)to touch your border(Border Line).The second rule is You do not let the opponent to cross over the 'No men's land'(The centre line),when the opponent touches the Border of your's.The opponent must raise a leg when the other one touches the border to tell them \"Lo,I am in your territory\".If the opponent touches the border,he can retreat to his field,no shame in that,but he don't get any points.But before retreating,if he touches anyone among them and leaves their field without getting caught,then The raider gets a point and the person who was touched by the raider is dead(Out).\n            Each team gets opportunity to raid other's field alternatively,and the first one to raid is decided by the toss of a coin,as usual as in most games.A number is decided to count the dead ones and which team reaches that number first loses the game to the another.Rules are pretty simple but the game is quite tough,you'll hurt yourself really bad.It takes a day to count the scratches on your body after the game.But that is the reason Tamils enjoy the game and they cherish it.Why on earth do they love slits,scratches and scars!Are they sick? One can wonder,but we can find the reason in their Sangam Literature,written circa 300 BCE. It says the bravery of men is reckoned by the number of scars on his body except on his back,because they thought to be dead in the field is far better than retreating.There are accounts to say about a woman who cut her breast because she found her son's body pierced by a long narrow spear-like weapon in his back rather in the chest.\n            So I like this game because it reflects the Tamil culture's important value which is giving high rank to bravery.I love to play the game with my friends in my village,a very refreshing game,I would say.

As my sister constantly says You’re lucky because you have a memory of a goldfish You remember absolutely nothing. It took me much to admit this  again fact. In contrast to my sister ( she has an extraordinary memory) I forget everything easily and keep looking for new emotions and adventures.\nA year ago an idea of beginning a blog encountered me as  advice from an English teacher. He recommended me to write in order to apply my English knowledge. Well…. Maybe it’s really time to make a resolution and do begin writing it.\nI’m going to kill two birds with one stone – my blog will help me to collect my memories and master my English The third bird  will be my hatred to writing. I hate writing since school. It was a family tragedy when I got a task to write a composition for my literature class. Such tasks made my family busy for an evening and anyway I always had a poor mark.  \nSo my dear blog (I heard it’s the way I have to interact with it) You will be about nothing.\ngood\nShe: I decided my blog will be about nothing. Just a blog)))))))))\nHe: lol I think I will win :P you won't be able to write about nothing for very long :)\nShe: sure. I have so much nothing in my head to write about\n\nLet’s get started!\n",

People will start purchasing all the items from the Internet. New methods of transportation may speed up the delivery to the purchaser home and, as a result, it will improve the quality of service. The new communication networks will transform the whole world into the big village where everyone will be able to make contact any person.

Remember this is fundamental for each interview.\n\nThe day of the event dress not to formal but also not to informal. Try to be spontaneus and not too much sliced. Also, it is nice to see polite and smile person. Do not talk too much is a sympton of anxiety. The first part of the interview is mainly about your private life and study. Maybe you can receive some general information about your last job.\n\nDon't worry about people who will interviews you. I worked in that staff more than ten years ago (new employees recruiments) and I can guarantee that for the first interview it is important only to receive a good impression. If you'll do it (and I'm sure you will give it) you'll receive another appointment.\n\nI hope to have said everything. When you come here send me a text. It will a great pleasure to have a coffee together.\n\nGood luck for the future.\n\n\n\n",

The main character is the father of one of the children. The man is really frightened and this situation gets him more and more desperate and he cannot control his reactions.\n\nI enjoyed this film a lot because it attracts your attention all the time. In my opinion it is so really exciting because you are constantly thinking where the girls are or who can be the kidnaper.\n\nI would recommend \"Prisoners\" to the student film club because it has the features that you want. I believe that if you are looking for an interesting thriller, this thriller is the correct one. However, there is a problem and it is that the film shows much violence and it should not be seen by children, only by teenagers or older people. At any case, in my opinion it is a great film which many people would enjoy if they see it.",

Some people think young people spend enough time to help their communities; however, others disagree with the idea. Although young people are required to help their communities every week, actually it is still not enough.\n    It is true that young people are required to help their communities by their schools or companies.

Actually, there are many communities still do not receive enough help, or many social issues and events would not be discussed again and again. Many reasons result in this phenomenon.\n    The world becomes more and more competitive, young people have to spend much time to cultivate themselves to survive in this society. Young people are not only have to spend much time to make them be professional in one specific subject, they also have to know a wide range of knowledge.

  "text": "The  Shakespeare’s path to Russia was rather thorny. This is not surprising. While William Shakespeare wrote his plays and made the Thespian art to flourish in England, in Russia was very dim and sinister period of Ivan IV the Terrible’s reign. So, in Russian print the name of Shakespeare is mentioned first in 1748. First translations appear in the end of 18th century, but this is not Shakespeare actually because they are made from German or French and the translators change plots as they want (and turn them into some tearjerkers as a rule). For example, in one of the “Hamlet” translations the main subject of the play turns out to be the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia and Ophelia in a meantime appears to be a daughter of Claudius (obviously to make Hamlet torture’s completely unbearable). \nIt is close to unbelievable, but at first critics and educated people find Shakespeare rude, unpoetic and unpatriotic (shame on you, blind and narrow-minded people! Once more into the breach!). But everything  changes quite rapidly then. The first accurate translation of Hamlet from the original is published in 1828. By 1855 only six plays has left non-translated. It comes to fashion and becomes honorable to translate Shakespeare. Russian society gradually begins appreciating Shakespeare’s skill in portraying  greatness, depth, and complexity  of a human being. \n“The sun of Russian poetry”, Alexander Pushkin takes his English lessons for the sake of being able to read Shakespeare. And his drama Boris Godunov is certainly inspired by  Macbeth. In the poetical drama Masquerade by other famous Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov we clearly read  Othello’s features. And these are like nodes on the tree of Shakespeare’s genius. \nSince that time Shakespeare has been one of our favorite artists.   We love his simplicity and veracity, we adore his multiplicity and fantasy, we appreciate his straightness and audacity, we prize  his delicacy and his funny bone of course! \n",

  "text": "Hello, my name is Sebastian and I will talk about Azul Historico, which is a restaurant in Mexico City. The restaurant location is in the street Isabela Católica number 30, suburb Centro Historico in Mexico City. Azul Historico is a different restaurant and is located in a patio of an old building in the zocalo, the type of architecture of the place is colonial and between the tables are some trees, and this trees covers the diners when they are eating. When you are eating you can look some birds who are in the trees, so it make unusual and different this restaurant than others. The service are good, the waiters serve excellent, the food is delicious, but some periods of the year the place is full of people and you need a reserve or wait a long time for a table. \nThe cost of the restaurant dishes is expensive  and the cost is around 150-300 pesos. \nIt is so difficult to choose three best dishes of the place but these three are some of the best typical food of Mexico: the \"Cochinita Pibil\", \"Chichilo Negro\" and \"Carne Enchipoclada\".  \n\"Carne Enchipoclada\" you need to choose the meat (pork tenderloin, beef steak or deer meat) and it is accompanied by a sauce of chile chipotle with potatoes cambray.  \"Chichilo Negro\" is a dish and you need to choose some of the three type of meat that I said, but this are accompanied by a combination of 7 different types of moles originating of oaxaca and the last dish is the typical \"Cochinita Pibil\" of Mexico. \nIf you want a different and unique restaurant you need to go Azul Historico, because it has a delicious food, some times have a regional music and the service are excellent.

  "text": "If we consider the potentiality of this means of communication, the  television would be one of the most important invention of this last century. On the other hand, despite the numerous documentaries, news and cultural programs which are passed on every day, another fact that must be considered is the incredible amount of the so-called rubbish TV, which has been impacting badly on the younger generation, and the extreme violence of some movies transmitted even during times that should be considered as a protected band for children.  Furthermore I should probably mention the enormous amount of advertisements that every single day people are forced to watch once they have switched on this box. In my opinion, the real problem of this potentially useful tool is due to the fact that television is essentially a passive means of communication. As a matter of fact televiewers are not able to decide the palimpsest, but they still can decide to switch the television off.",

Is the traditional music of a country more important than the International music that is heard everywhere nowadays?\n\nMusic is a special world. It has it's own rules, tools and the people who are specialized in it. Over decades music is the eternally art which develop day by day.\nWe need music in most of our times or even every single day, to enrich our days with happiness and joy, and also to melt away sorrows or depression, that can affect us and prevent ourselves from doing the best.\nMusic is a science ! yes it is. Which has many branches and types, those are traditional: owned by any part of the world, and the other international types that all people over the world are share it.\nThe traditional or local music of a certain area has it's thumb print on the person of that part. And the instruments used in that local music may vary from sort to another. Because the people tend to make it from their own basic culture. For example, In Northern Sudan people have been used \" Tambor\" as a traditional spiritual tool for their songs.\nInternationally, the kinds of music are many, however, most of them share the same instruments. In particular the Piano is a universal tool that is used by many musicians as a primary controller of the rhythm of the Orchestra. \nLast and not the least, music is a sort of treatment to those who are suffering, so regardless of it's type or nationality it's a kind of medicine to the soul. And I enjoy it very much. ",

  "text": "\nThe prohibition and destruction of books has occurred in historical periods as the inquisition, the knowledge was manipulated by the powerful social statements such as the Catholic Church and monarchies since the knowledge through books had become a threat to continue underpinning their power within the social pyramid; therefore, those powerful social statements chose what books did not violate their thought in order to transcribe them. Although, some ideas were maintained; (for instance, the astronomy by Galileo Galilei) the book-burning caused a delay in the knowledge because if books were burned, the knowledge could not circulate.  \n Nevertheless, a knowledge revolution was created with the invention of the printing mobile types by Gutenberg (1440) due to it element gave access to the knowledge recovering significant books from Plato, Aristotle and so on, authors against political, religious and social issues that spread their ideas to more people becoming aware of the power of the written word, creating social revolutions such as the French and American ones. In addition, it was produced the collective readings through the ecclesiastical method with the purpose of disseminating the knowledge embodied in the books to all social classes.\n On the other hand, at present, people identify another knowledge revolution, the internet in which the access to the knowledge is easier and faster leaving aside books. \nFrom the above, as far as I am concerned, when Franklin Rosemont argues that ¨ books cannot be killed by fire. People die, but books never die¨ it depends on the historical time and the technical revolution of this time taking into account that that knowledge uprising is always accompanied by a technical revolution which supports the entrance of the information; for instance, in the inquisition, the knowledge was limited because it was embodied in books. Although there was an oral tradition, the knowledge was accommodated to the political and religious thought of the speaker; so, the most efficient and objective way to transmit the knowledge was by books and it was not possible because of the burning. Nonetheless, with the invention of the printing type mobile, the knowledge was different for the access to it. If one book was burned, there were ten books more without restriction. In contrast, nowadays, the books are not necessary at all; because of the internet network facilitate even more the knowledge. That is why; I could accommodate the phrase by Franklin saying that ¨the knowledge cannot be killed by people because the knowledge is infinite. ¨\n",

  "text": "Nowadays a part of the people buy a lot of things that they don’t need. In this essay we are talking about above all with rich people. So money, today, are really important in our life and in this case rich people are very lucky. They have much money to buy things that they need, and things that they don’t need. So it seems that these people can live happily and peacefully, without problems, but this is not true. In fact above all about rich families the children are in trouble with their family, above all when they have their parents separated. Also most of the children grow up spoiled because of the large amount of money of their family, and they grow up with the thing that they want more and more things. But in the other side there are poor people that aspire to become rich. And these people don’t have money for things that they don’t need and also for things that they need. So in this case the money are more important than other things. So in my opinion today we can’t live without money, but we have to consider more to feel good with your family and with yourself.\n\n",

If this will also be the case for out future, then I think that today we underestimate our future. I am sure only about one thing: technologies will have a more important place in our lives. Maybe in 50 years people won't work as we do now, instead will build only robots. Maybe in 50 years we will find out how our brain works and we will be able to create an artificial intelligence system that would solve all our problems. I would like to think that in the future we will explore more the universe and we will colonise other planets. Maybe by doing this we would be able to find other civilisations and exchange technologies with them. I'd like to think that we will find a method to travel through the universe at the higher speeds than the speed of light. I don't think that people will live forever in 50 years, but I hope that the life of our children will be better than ours. Hopefully, I have chances to be alive in 50 years, so maybe I will see the future with my own eyes.",

For example, we could think about some odd cars that can fly or become invisible. But I don't think that in ten or twenty years the scientific progress will be able to produce this type of transport, so we should imagine something simpler.\n\nActually, in my opinion, in the future there will be faster transport. In addition, means of transport will be able to produce less pollution. Even if nowadays people don't use public transport, in the future they will.\n\nAnd how will our way of travelling change? In the future everyone will be able to go on holiday all around the world since the transport will be faster and cheaper.\n\nTo sum up, I think that means of transport in the future will make our life easier, both when we have to go to work or to school and when we want to travel. Transport will also respect the environment and nature. Don't you think that this future is fantastic?",

I was invited to help at a concert by my English teacher. I did a lot to make this concert better. My teacher asked me to find some songs about rainbows and extracts from the books about children. Moreover, I went to Vilnius primary school and invites schoolchildren to come to a concert. I had to make one hundred invitation cards. The cards included the programmee of the concert and some photos of children from all the world. I was really excited about it. It is a very good and useful experience. I gained a lot of experience while organizing an event. Also, I learned that you have to be very enthusiastic and self-confident because finding the sponsors for a concert is quite a difficult task I liked that teacher trusted me. I did everything by myself because everyone had sometihng to do on their own.I hope that I will use this experience in my future. \n\nSee you soon, \nRasa",

To start with, you must decide, what kind of shopping do you prefer and how much money you have. If you want to go to the cheap shopping, you have to go to the Teremky.You can find many shops there with second-hand clothes you taste. There are many good things from Asia, America and Europe, of course. If you have enough money for Kiev luxury shopping called `gold shoppping`, you`d rather go on Khreshatik street. You can also find many shops with brand, expensive clothes from well-known world designers. I like to go shopping there with my best friends at the weekend.I often buy second-hand old-fashioned jeans, skirts, trousers, jackets and shoes.

  "text": "Art/Music is less important than science/technology.\n\nIn my opinion, technology become more and more important than art which be a necessary part in our life. Most of people in this world can’t live without technology. As soon as we open our eyes every day, we begin to use technology such as alarm, cell phone and light. The more technology we use the more important it is.\n     \n     Technology makes us easy to connect our family, friends and co-workers. We can talk to our family and friends immediately, which is not limited by space. I can call my dad who live in New York now then call my friend living in Norway after first call. Therefore, if I studied abroad fifty years ago, I couldn’t call my family directly and it is also not an easy job. However, technology made it easier ten years ago and it became more common in recent years. It can’t believe that we keep in touch with our family and friends not only voice and message but also video call, now. \n     \n     Technology is one of important part in our life, which has made life more convenient. Before computer was born in this world, we used paper to list something which we should afford it could disappear or be ruined by something. Therefore, we use calculator to count numbers in a few second. In the old age we calculated number by our brain that might lead to some mistakes. Our life has transformed into an easy way by technology. Besides, the grandest invention is Internet. I sit in front of my computer and I acquire news around the world. If I am hungry, I could order some delicious foods online. As a person said ‘’Sitting near a computer, you will get the world.’’\n\n     It is easier to contract entertainment which could release our stress immediately. In modern world, stress always disturb our life. Pressure exist everywhere; for instance, your boss was angry and shouted on you or you should carefully deal with the relationship between you and your father-in-law. When you can’t breathe in your life you need some entertainment; for example, you can listened music with your cellphone or watched some funny videos after all things that bothered you. It lower our blood pressure and release our stress. Technology enable us to touch entertainment immediately.\n\n     Technology has changed our life in many ways which brings many advantages for us such as convenience, easy to connect friends and easier to contract entertainment. In conclusion, in these three premises I consider that technology and science is important rather than art and music. Science practical improve our life.\n",

  "text": "Have you read any sport magazine before? There are a lot of magazines in many fields of sports. In magazine, they are telling us we can see a lot of games no matter where we are. Developed technology, we can see the game which happened in the opposite of the earth. Time and place aren't matter for people to watch the game. Everybody has a favorite sport. Soccer is the one of the famous sport for many people. World cup has been the world famous festival. People can enjoy just seeing the soccer game and they are eager to root for their favorite team. Why the soccer has been one of the best sport in the world? Here are 2 reasons.\n\nFirst of all, soccer is more active than other sports. Activation makes people exciting and remember their memory. This activation make us also enjoy seeing and play the game. For example, American football always has a moment to set the position. To me, it is boring point when I see the American football. I can give you another example. Watching the baseball game also bores me. Sometimes, game just finished with pitcher and catcher's catch ball game. Other athletes just stand there and watch the game just like us. However, in soccer, every single player touch the ball, even the goalkeeper has a chance to get the ball. On this point, there is second reason I can say.\n\nSecond reason is that soccer involved for all players to participate into the game. For baseball, if hitter couldn't hit the ball, other players would not need to move at all. To me, that is weird. Players are on the same ground and some of people are playing the game and some are not. Playing almost 3 hours, some players couldn't touch the ball. Can we say these players participating in the game? I would not rather say yes.\n\nIf somebody wanted to play a soccer, I would recommend that he or she has to have a stretching because soccer is very active sport so always has a possibility to be injured. Also, I will say you should wear the soccer shoes and socks. Those items will help you not to be injured. Drinking enough water would be good habit to enjoy not only soccer but also any other sport.\n\nNowadays, many people have their own favorite sports but people are starting to ignore other sports except their favorite sport. We need to respect other sports and other people's perspectives. Soccer could be one of the boring sport to other people.     ",

  "text": "Dear Jo,\n\nI'm very pleased with your letter. I'm going to try to give you some advice. In the Czech republic there are many places you should visit. The Czech republic is wealth for a history. For example, ours capital city Prague there are many historical buildings like Carl's bridge, Cathedral of St. Vit, big clock called Orloj and so many others. In Prague is many good shops with clothes, souvenirs and many good things to buy.\nIf you prefer to go to nature I can recommend you ours mountains Krkonoše, Jeseníky or Šumava. There is very beautiful nature, calm and fresh air. You can go there only for a walk or for some sports like running or cycling.\nIf you go to south Morava, you should definitely try some vines or drink called Slivovice. \nHere is also many nice castles. For example, near Prague is castle called Karlštejn where lived Karel IV. or castle called Buchlovice which is on south-east of your country near the city Uherské Hradiště. These are very nice castles.\nOtherwise, the opportunities for a job here is quite a lot. It depends what job you would like to do.\nI don't know what to write more. If you would like to ask something or get to know more information about some place just let me know.\n\nBest regards,\nPavel",

It is also good to adopt an animal which it don't have a home and food and give in this love and affection.\n  On the other hand there are a lot of disadvantages of owing a pet in big citiew.

The first thing that I would suggest TV authors is focusing a set of strategic topics for an advanced society. Environmental protection for instance, or more practically the correct use of the water in our houses. Another example can be represented by the first aid activities and so on. The topics can be easily focused if we have in mind a model of society where individuals have a central role. Several contents could have an educative value, for example those concerning our relationships with others, or our relationship with nature and with different cultures and religions. All these topics by using creativity and new technologies can be faced in a way to make them soft and adapt to entertain.",

I think some of you have already known this news.\nHere are some basic informations about the news. A charter plane carrying 72 passengers, including players from Brazilian soccer team Chapecoense, crashed near Rionegro, Colombia, according to the country’s civil aviation department. Nine crew members were also on board. The civil aviation agency had initially announced that six passengers, three players, two crew members, and one journalist, survived the crash. I think it is a catastrophe to  victims and their families. Recently, more and more airplane accidents occur. Although I have never taking airplane, I would feel worry if I travel by plane.

Everybody knows what separate rubbish into different bins means but, big part of the society believes that it is not worth doing it if there are people that does not recycle. I would answer to them that, then, how do they explain all the sheets of paper, crystal and plastic items that have been made of recycled materials allowing us to save tons of primal resources?\n\nSaving energy is the other grand method available to everyone. Using its respective light bulbs, household appliances and any other thing that saves energy is the only way that individuals can help but, it is not effective. Although an entire town or city contributes to saving energy in their homes, it cannot be compared with the waste of energy that industries make. In this case, restrictions should be implemented by the government.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, there is a good argument for supporting recycle, which is the following one: The biggest waste of energy take part in primal resources industries, if we reuse all the materials that had already been exploited, we would reduce at least half of its costs.\n",

There is involved with a recycling spirits in Edo period.\n     In Edo period, there was the society that was called “super recycling-oriented society”. Almost products and materials were recycled and changed new products. People did this without special efforts. It was done very natural in their lives. There were many specialists to repair, recycle and collect products in Edo. Used clothes were sold by “gyosyo”, that means peddler. In 1723, there are 1182 secondhand clothing stores. It was just the number of union members so in fact, there more secondhand clothing stores in Edo.  The key point why expanded used clothes industry is “kimono”.  Kimono has very simple structure. It can be made from used clothes to patch and darn.   Another point is that, the cloth was more valuable than now. So people set a high value on the cloth.  According to these reasons, used clothes spirits took hold in japan. After that, western clothes became popular in Japan, the recycling system was forgot for a long time. However, secondhand clothing stores are increasing recent years. There are many secondhand clothing stores now. Japanese people have the spirits of recycling and loving old things still now.\n",

There comes no surprise that it is totally difficult to find a necessary thing with a good price in a defined time through a crowd.  Once I remember myself hanging around in the shopping mall Akropolis in order to buy shoes in two hours. I did not managed to get particular one, because of size, which some shops suddenly could not suggest as well as the quality of others  did not seem to be valuable for  fixed prices. So, I did not buy   new shoes that day,despite thatI was happy for getting rid of crowd and shops. \n\nSecond,shopping malls have full places of advertisements and loud songs playing. There is no surprise that a person visits a big shopping mall after his long working day. He is tired and because of winter he wears a warm coat. What does it happen? He hears different kind of songs, advertisements  for sales and this confused person starts buying things which are not useful to him in reality. The  problem goes after the problem and a person starts to feel sick. Also, It is a well-known fact, that   it is totally hot to be with coat in a shopping mall in winter season.  The problem is that a person has to carry his coat in a hand near his other purchases , what is not so easy.\n\nFinally,not every assistant is able to advise you appropriate. There are some assistants who  if you ask or even do not ask, they start suggesting the best their products as well as the most expensive ones to you. This can make your shopping really annoying, because some type of people need to check by themselves in order to evaluate the quality of product.\n\nTo sum up, shopping is not always an enjoyable thing, because it takes time, it is often full of people and a person can be annoyed quickly by incompetent assistants, who eager to help you by suggesting the most expensive products.  So, shopping does not always provide good feelings.",

In my case is not really a sport in itself, it is a cultural activity which needs a big physical effort. I am talking about dancing, specifically ballet. I consider it one of the best sporty and cultural activities because you keep fit at the same time that you express yourself making an art stuff.\n\nFor dancing you need some mental and physical skills, but none of them are as hard as people think. You have to be a disciplined and well-balanced person, that's it. Both characteristics will help you in other type of tasks and will improve your future development. \n\nThe start is the hardest part considering that your body is not used to do this kind of sport; however, once you are in it everything becomes easier and you feel healthy and much more active. So, if you are starting it, don't give up because of difficulties are coming, just relax and be aware that you and your body require time to adapt to this new activity. You will notice how the improvements come up without thinking too much. \n\nOne of the things that I enjoy the most is that you dance in a group therefore you meet people and you can make a friendship after a while. You must not be in your own, otherwise you could not dance in a company, so that you share your passion with people that feel the same and that, make a strong relationship forever.\n\nI encourage everyone to try it, I am sure you will become a better person.",

  "text": "MY FAVOURITE SPORT\n\nChoosing a sport to practise is a complicated thing. You should choose something that you enjoy, but at the same time, something you can afford to pay for. As a result of that, I have tried many sports in my life. My favourite is diving. Although you may think that is a dangerous sport, which can be, the adrenaline rush you feel when you are in the water makes it worth the danger. \n\nIf you are going to start practise it, I would recommend you to start taking lessons with an expert instructor. It is very important to check the equipment first. If are not used to do it you can make a mistake, and then it is when the sport became dangerous. After a few lessons you will be able to go diving on yourself and enjoy the sensation of freedom that provides you this sport. It is like you would be isolated from the world, just you and the ocean. \n\nI have to say that it is one of the most amazing feeling that I have ever felt in my life. I encourage you to try it.",

How will be our life in the future? \nTo begin with this, the main change will be the use of renewable resource instead of fossil fuels. Nowadays, people is aware of environmetal problems and they will try to figure out. For example, all future houses will use solar cells to produce electricity.\nMoreover, there will be important thecnological advances in our life, like as intelligent mobile phones which could help us with day-to-day task. Not only they will be used to telephone, but we could pay with them. They will control our empty fridge and  if you run out of any vegetables, your mobile phone would warn your supermarket and they would bring it. \nHowever,Robots will not replace humans in the dairy tasks. So that, we should carry on dust cleaning or washing. Although, cars will be better than now, they will not fly yet.

  "text": "Probably one of the most discussed topics - global warming, is also most serious issue; world is facing today. Researchers have proved that human activities such as industrialization, deforestation etc. can trigger global warming. In this topic I would be highlighting some of the dangers of climate change and different ways through which government and individual may help to overcome this challenge.\nOne of the most evident effects of global warming is the depletion of the ice at North & South poles, in turn causing sea level rise and encroachment of land. These phenomenon caused serious damages to ecosystem and sea life. Further, continuous rising temperature is impacting weather patterns and leading to natural disasters. There are scientific evidences, that calamities like Katrina, Hud-Hud can be linked to global warming.\nAs global warming can have such serious impacts on life on Earth. It is high time to intervene and take action. Government can dictate strict norms to control pollution and carbon footprints. For example, governments can impose limits on emissions by manufacturing plants and force industries to help in forestation. Individuals can also play their part in controlling global warming. For example, individuals can reduce use of the plastic materials, use public transport to control emission, recycle waste material etc.\nTo conclude, global warming is serious concern which cannot be ignored any longer. Government & Individual both have role to play, in facing this biggest challenge of the Time, Earth is facing.\n",

  "text": "Academic culture refers to the attitudes, values and that are shown by the people who work or study in universities. After I joined ACU (Australian Catholic University) I have found vast differences in teaching method between Nepal and Australia.  In Nepal students study individually, do not ask questions with the tutor even if they are confused.  Meanwhile, Australian education is based on making students learn new skills.  Students need to have an active participation in discussion with their peers.  Besides, students are able to raise questions with the lecturer because they can express their opinion.  At first I felt difficult, stressed while studying in groups used to hesitate while sharing my ideas, opinion but now I am familiar with the academic culture.\nAcademic culture is challenge for many students for effective learning.  Peer learning is a small group of three to five students who are kept together to discuss the content and carry out educational activities in mutual engagement.  (Fisher, as cited in Strake, 2010, p.2), Peer learning is a two way learning process in which members of group feel easier to discuss the content.  It helps to know the importance of group work by giving and receiving feedback on particular tasks.   According to Hamp (2002), the goal of EAP (English For Academic Purpose) course is to teach students relevant study skills they need throughout their degree.  It helps to share the ideas, knowledge, among the students and make them think critically, by using formal language while writing and so on. \nIn conclusion, the adoption of Australian academic culture has developed strategies for my learning. I have become an independent learner and started to raise a question, share my opinion to the tutor. In the future I will enhance learning strategies by working actively in group.\n",

At the moment people who has got a handicap can not drive a car on theirself. This have got a devastating effect for her independence and freely living. When this people can drive a self driving car the feel more comfortable and the can live more freely. However, it is also important to remember that people with a handicap have got the same rights and chances as people without a handicap. \nSimilarly important is the fact that self driving cars are more saftier as no self driving cars. The rising number in deadly car accidents raise an important question to all of us. Is car driving really safe? Self driving cars are steered by a very modern software and this software is so exactly that the number of accidents will be decline.\n\nIn contrast self driving cars are very expensice and much people can not buy it. Self driving cars are very modern and drive with a very highly technically software. Rich people can buy it but people of the middle class not.

In my country for instance, people starts playing football at the very early age. The only thing they need is to have a ball and a piece of land. Everybody can practise football. \n\nThe other reason why I like practising football is because it is a collective sport. By playing football, you meet a lot of people of your age and make some friends. \n\nFinally, football is like all sports very good for health. Playing football at a regular basis helps to maintain a good health.\n\nMy advice to people who want to play football is to be passionate, to like and feel football. As I said, it is not mandatory to have all the dedicated  equipment but it could help. They also have to remember that it is a game of contacts. So, it might cause some injuries. And for those who like football but are scary to get injured, they still have the opportunity to watch games on TV and play video game console.",

  "text": "It is common to see during summer many people in parks practising sports, like running, biking, or just doing every kind of physical activities. Thanks god, I live right in the front of one big park. So, when I wake up every morning, also pushed because I am a very active person, I get such a motivation to go out and do something. \n\nI sometimes practise biking, running, or even dancing on sunday. I practise also swimming in my apartment's pool, and surfing when I manage to get to the beach. But, not only in summer I practise sports, once in winter I practise also fun sports, like skiing, snowboarding, and Ice skating, among others. \n\nSo, when my friends ask me which is my favourite sport, a problematic decision comes to my mind, simply because I like them all. But one of these sports comes to to the top of my thoughts more often: Running. Why do I enjoy running?. I do not have a quick answer, but I can slide some ideas.\n\nFirst, running is cheap. If you want to practise this sport, you can simply take a couple of sneakers, and any light sportswear, and start to run anywhere. There is no need of expensive technical clothes, or special fields, just you, and a place safe and with enough space. Nonetheless, if you really want to get into this sport as a pro, you can get to invest a lot on clothing and gadgets.\n\nSecond, running is simple. You do not need to get any special training when you start to run, you know it since you are a child. That said, running is probably the easiest sport to practise.\n\nNevertheless, once you started to practise running, and want to really get into it, and improve, I do recommend you to take care of your health a to find professional assistance. Injuries may happen for practicing it often if you do not know the way you step, or you do not take the necessary time to get the resistant that your body needs, for example.\n\n",

Furthermore, the court has walls and the ball can bounce off they.\n\nPadel is my favourite sport because it is so easy to play for everyone and it is funny when you play with people who has the same level to you.\n\nThe most important thing that you have to think when you start to play this sport is that it is a game and you should improve your level fast because it is an easy sport.\n\nI started when I was 18 years and I played 2 days per week.\nNow, I play padel four days per week.\n\nI am an addict to padel!",

  "text": "Extremadura is a small place where you can not find many transport types.\n\nFirst of all, the most of the people in Extremadura use the car for going to the job, to university or school. The car is a quick, cheap and easy transport since you can use it when you want and you can park it where you want. When you use the car, you do not have to think in timetables and you don´t have to pay expensive tickets for travelling. However, I think that this transport has some disadvantages, for instance: if in a small city there are a lot of cars, the pollution will increase and the environment will be injured. Also, when a city is small the people should walk to different places since everything is near to your houses.\nRelated to the use of the car, I would like to say that the Extremadura´s roads need a big reparation because, for example, the road between Cáceres and Badajoz is very damaged and it is difficult to drive for it. \n\nIn Extremadura, the second transport most used is the bus. On the one hand, there are buses that connect the several neighbourhoods of the cities with the centre of them. On the other hand, there are buses for travelling large distances. I think that the urban buses have improved in Cáceres. The last year, the mayor changed the old buses by new buses without increase the prices. Now, it is securier to travel than last years. Also, the seats of this transport are more clean and the bus driver go saying the name of each stop. In the bus stop there are devices that advice to the people the minutes that they have to wait to the arrived of the bus.\nFinally, in Extremadura the transport least used is the train. The ticket is very expensive and the trains are very old.",

  "text": "4. Do you learn more at school or on placement?\n\nNearly every education will apply a placement in their education program, to get the skills and experience of their pupils to a higher level. But, is it also that necessary? Where do you actually learn more, at school or on placement?\n\nFirst of all before arguing this question, it is important to compare the answers with people who are on the same education and school. Because there can be a lot of differences in the characteristics of those two subjects. After that, having said I can clearly write down my opinion about this question. \n\nI think that at my school the balance of this civil education isn’t right and fair at all. Because the numbers of theory lessons about our discipline are by far many hours less than I expected to get. This makes it nearly a complete self study education, which shouldn’t be that way at this level of schooling. So because of this, the placement is always a step ahead to choose for at this question because they will teach you directly more.\n\nIn addition, on placement the things you learn are always focused on that particular job and company. So the details and information they teach you will be more useful in your future career than the random information about the subjects at school. So this makes it already two against zero for the placement. \n\nAnd finally the third and last reasons why I think you learn more on placement than at school. When you go to school you have to follow lessons which are off course useful for your knowledge but, the way of following this lessons are not a natural work pattern. In a natural work pattern you have to do, also like school, your tasks but the communication is also an important part of it. This important way communication lacks at school, because it’s a nearly a one direction way of communicating from the teachers. You have to make a test and they will give you a rating for it. While on placement they work more in an evaluating way to improve skills.\n\nSo with the these three arguments all going in the same direction to explain my opinion at this question, I think it has not to be explained any further now. \n",

  "text": "Over the last years, people´s attidute has been changing. The necessity declined that working and living needs to be fairly close to each other. Managing long distances seems to be normal nowadays. Moreover, people enjoy being unbound and therefore, they are willing to travel long distances.  However, public transport has been critised more and more over the last years because of its inconenvience. Some people go even so far and don´t assume that public transport will have a future at all.\n\n\nA lot of public services were cut down in order to save money. Therefore, busses are not running as often or reglulary as they used to. Especially in the countryside, public transport is no alternative to cars due to the lack of frequency. Consequently, people prefer taking the car. Firstly, because they gain independence therewith. Secondly, they can visit each place without any circumstances. For instance,there is no need to change the bus. It is also more convenient to go to work by car as you can leave when it suits you and not because the last bus is running. In addition, the car is also more convenient in respect of the timing. After having had a long day at work, people long to get home as quick as possible.\n\nFurthermore, ticket prices have been increased rapidly in the last years. Travelling by train as a family or group is often far more expensive than taking the car. \n\nNevertheless, public transport still provides several advantages in comparison to taking the car. For example, it is no parking space required. Sitting in the bus can also be quite relaxing, especially considering the heavy traffic during rush hours. Finally, it still provides a useful way of travel for all who don´t have a driving licence.\n\nIn the end, the service of public transport needs to change to attract more people and to have a rosieer future. However, it will remain in the future as still many people use it or even depend on it.\n",

  "text": "   Nowadays almost every person in the world watches movies temporarily or permanently . It can be done by going to a cinema or watching movies at home. I like both ways. Regarding my preferences, I would like to admit that silent genre conquered me. Of course, unprepared viewer can't understand inner beauty of this genre and will choose something mediocre. However, simplicity in some cases can be very good and smart. When I want to watch something easy, comedy or horror comes to my mind. I don't appreciate melodramas or love stories much, but they should be paid attention to.\n   In my opinion, very few people use movies for broadening the mind. They are simply relaxing by such a way.",

In this network you create a profile of your car,  write a list of improvements you have done in it,  upload photos and movies about you car and of course you meet a lot of people with the same interests. Drive2 users often have a lot of technical questions about their cars.So they often need help of professionals. I think that it is necessary to involve some professional mechanics to give advice to users.\nThe other website I often use is Google.com because it is the greatest searching service ever created by human beings. I think it is the best among other searching systems because of it is very fast and you get only the information you asked for and nothing excess. I think that many google users will be happy if the developpers bring more useful information to the main page, for example weather information , carrency rates or hot news.

  "text": "\nThis topic leads me to think of my brother's child. This result in different views of whether people accept it is easier to raise children now a day. I hold the belief that the children are really easy to raise than before.\n\nFirst, the parents only want fewer kids, so the children's resource must plentiful than 50 years ago. I hold the example. My brother only has one child, but my grandfather has four children. My brother's child can very easy to get the toy which he required directly. However, my father never got the toy when he was a child, because too many kids need to be fed. My grandfather must work hard to support his children by additional job. They had no money could use on entertainment. That is why I mention that my father never got the toy when he was a child. Now a day, every child can get more and more resource from their parents because of less competing by other child. That is what I say that the fewer children can get more resource and easier to be raise.\n\nSecond, more and more infrastructures appear in our city. Of course, that must include the health care system. For instance, in the big city we can very easy to find the specific space to serve our children, such as special toilet and Breast-Feeding Room in every subways. These kinds of space can make parents comfortable and concentrate on their care. My brother told me when his baby should be feed when they walked on the street. They can quickly to feed his baby. That is friendly for children and parents. On the other hand, the software infrastructures are important as well as hardware system. Health care system also helps the parents to care of their children, because of people can spend less money to recover their disease by insurance. This is a good example to show that the infrastructure can help parents to care of their children.\n\n Of course, some people may be moved to disagree with my position on this issue. That being said, I still feel that the reasons I have presented was strong ones, such as more resources and infrastructure.\n",

  "text": "     No future for public transport is one of the worst things in our life. Thus, our state spears no effect on fight it, transportation now is very over crowdedness and difficult, especially in the rush hour which people leave their jobs and go to their houses at 2 o'clock , the main reason for that is the increasing the number of people in our country ( housing problem ) and the result of that a lot of accidents has been done and a lot of people were died .\n     Recent U.S. study revealed that the bus ride and trains regularly maintains the agility of the body and helps in reducing weight. According to a study published by the journal «American Journal of Medicine Brevintev» in August / August next that the more public transport in the city, where population has become leaner and healthier. The U.S. researchers from two universities in the state of Pennsylvania and the Foundation «Rand» American research and development staff to monitor regularly attend public transportation or go to work by car within a year. The study results showed that people who ride transportation .\n     Public decreased their weight by three kilograms on average, compared to people who use the car to move and the study attributed this result to walk to the bus stop and running to catch the bus in the expected position requires goer public transport more traffic, while this does not happen with motorists. The study pointed out that the public transport network in the United States has not been expanded since a long time compared to the situation in Germany, for example. He appealed to the experts in political circles in the United States to invest more money in public transportation and improving security in the ways of the infantry in cities and make them more attractive to encourage people to use public transport. The supervisor of the study, John M.. MacDonald of the University of Pennsylvania: «investment in public transport will allow the possibility of reducing obesity people».\n     Suffered the transport sector in the Arab countries of the many shortcomings and poor performance and is a form of environmental pollution and this is due primarily to a lack of the capacity of public institutions to develop strategies necessary to intervene appropriately and allocate investments effectively and improve the organizational capacity and result\nSo it did not materialize for the transport sector often necessary capacity to provide reliable and safe transportation and moderate cost and in spite of the high demand for transportation services in the Arab countries are still public transport systems are undeveloped and drive people to rely on private cars.\nIt has been observed, for example, that increasing the number of cars varied between 7 and 10 percent per year in Jordan and this situation is similar to what happens in other Arab countries, and despite the investments in roads and infrastructure in the last few decades, the performance of this sector remains weak as a result of congestion severe urban centers and poor air quality in many cities, land degradation and high rates of emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.\n     The optimistic opinion, some people object that \"no future for public transport\" saying that the future of public transport is clear and the prof of that in ancient there wasn't any transport and by the time people starting to invent new means of transportation ranging from cattle, cart, carriage, boat, ship, lorry, private cars until the plane, so they hope that the transportation be best by the creative people .\n     In the other opinion, the pessimistic opinion, in developed countries like Japanese and Kuwait we don't find like these problems because they have a good planning, they make ways underground and overground, then they have ways only for people and ways only for cars, finally, we should have a good plan and the government should care with that and plan for traffic regulation to solve this problem .\n",

He just realized how to solve one of the biggest physical challenges mankind has been interested in for ages. Time travelling! We had been looking at this problem from wrong angle all the time.The periodic move of minute hand compared to smooth path of seconds hand. We were trying to reverse the flow of time, but that is not possible at all. We have to focus on the breaks. Time is running, seemingly continuously, same as seconds hand on his clock. But we got this perception just because our eye can see only limited number of images in a time period. If time period is long enough, like minute, we can see strict distinction between one and two. That is the key! We need to slow down the time! In other words, we have to be fast enough to see that breaks in time. Then we can just jump inside it and move either direction, as we wish. Peter grabbed his notebook and immediately wrote all this down. He can’t forget any word of it! ",

  "text": "I´m going to talk about the famine and thirst in Africa. There is a large number of African children, who suffers with the lack of food and clean water. Children are supposed to be the future of their countries, but in Africa, especially in the countries in sub-Sahara Africa, there are many cases of famine-extreme cases, so children spend very difficulties. Their education is affected, for example. They have to walk away long distances to have clean water and to work too to survive. Children who have to work and cannot go to school, won´t get a better life and their dreams never will come true. Unfortunately this is the sad reality.\nBesides that, the lake of food and clean water are responsible for many diseases, which are responsible for a large number of deaths, because there aren´t enough sources to cure the populations.\nEar we have some of them: anemia/ anemia; rickets and malnutrion…\nThe principals cause for famine in Africa are the ethnic conflicts, which causes warms; the decrease of fertile grounds and the use of ground only to produce monocultures to export.\n",

Sunday morning, Tom was walking as usually when he saw a big poster with a picture of a big motorway. In that moment he understood that the mayor will build a big motorway there, next to the river. Suddenly, he thought that the workers will cut all the trees, and the squirrels will lose their refuges, so he thought that he had to do something immediately. He wrote a letter to the town hall explaining the situation and asking to stop the construction. He suggested to build the motorway in another place to save the squirrels and to protect that beautiful landscape. The mayor accepted Tom's proposal, and he ordered to build the motorway in another different place. Tom arrived home very late. It had been a very long and tiring day, but Tom felt he had achieved something really good. ",

  "text": "Travelling by public transport is expensive and uncomfortable. The trains and buses are not big enough. There is not enough space for your legs and you often do not get a seat. This will not be a problem if you travel only short distances, but on long journeys that will be very uncomfortable. Travelling with your personal car is much more comfortable. There is the possibility to set up your seat. It is your own decision when you get up, because there are no time boundaries. There are no times when you have to be at the bus stop. If you use public transport for long distances in a city, you will often change the bus. There is the risk that you would not get the connecting bus and so you are stressed.\nIn conclusion travelling by car is the easiest and best way. I think that it is not possible to use public transport because there are no buses or trains. Maybe car sharing is an innovative alternative to public transport. Many people use their car alone. The most of the time they have free seats in their cars. So they could spare their cars with other people",

  "text": "here are many fields of study that have not been discovered or researched by humans. Many reasons cause the research hardly going on. As a result, there is the debate whether educational institutes have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing field of study in which they are unlikely to succeed. In my opinion, I agree with the statement with qualifications by following reasons.\n\tAdmittedly, some of the research need to invest many resources that educational institutes cannot afford. Such research indeed will fail. Educational institutes should dissuade students.\n\tHowever, if there is not lack of the resource for the field of study, Educational institutes should support students for their study area . Education’s greatest purpose is to encourage student to attempt and learn from the fail. Take Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, for example. He tried a lot of different materials to make filament of the light bulb. Once, people think he would succeed.\n\tEven though the research really cannot succeed. Students can learn some things from the course of the research. In the course of the research, students will think how to develop process of the research and know which segment will cause the problem making the research fail. In addition, students in the course of research maybe create serendipity. Like Alexander Flrming Alexander , the inventor of the antibiotic, discovered the Penicillin accidentally from the research of the germ.\n\t“You must do the thing you think you cannot do.” said by Eleanor Roosevelt. The invaluable thing is to turn the impossibility to possibility. Therefore,Educational institutes should encourage the student attempting the field which unlikely to succeed.\n",

  "text": "Hi Anne, \nThanks for your e-mail. It is very exciting to hear you are coming to Latvia. \nPersonally , I think the best time to come is in the summer. Because at this time we have a lot of interesting activities like concerts , festivals and so on. \nIf you want to meet young people I suggest you stay in a youth hostel. \nThe first good thing is they have low cost and here you can meet students from all around the world. \n\nIn spite of that the weather has to be warm in summer , you should bring with you  not only light clothes but also  jacket for rainy day. \n\nThanks also for your invitation to join the group. I would love to do if I am free. \nI will be able to show you and your friends the most interesting places in my area. \nLet me know when you are coming. \n\nWarm regards\n",

  "text": "When I was in high school, I loved to go to different kinds of activities. Quite often, I felt difficult to balance both my study and hobby at the same time. So, having a good time-management have become important in my study. I remember that I had a drama play which was held just couple weeks before final exams. However, instead of focusing on my study, I paid more attention on rehearsals. As a result, one of my subjects failed because I did not have enough time to catch on the lessons. At that moment I felt regretful and frustrated.\n\nFrom that experience, I have realized that I need to change my learning strategies for a successful study. Firstly, to know what is priority is essential for achieving success. Therefore, I avoided social activities during the period of exam. In the same way, Rowh (2006) points out that it is important to get controlled our self. In addition, not only putting things in order but also well-organized planning are helpful to manage times. As Academic skill Unit (2012) states that daily, weekly and semester planner can benefit for arranging our times (P.22). In my case, I planned the activities into a proper time because the planners clearly show me the outline in the near future.\n\nWithout a doubt, this valuable experience let me know the importance of taking responsibility to my own learning. More significantly, I understand that time-management and planning are crucial in academic life. Therefore, in the future, I will keep improving those abilities and become a more oragniezed person.\n",

Do you want to know why is the most enjoyable?\nWhen we watch a football game everybody is expecting that at any time someone will score a goal or do some jink that gets us excited and that's the magic of the football.\nIf you want to start practicising this sport you have to get fit and run a lot because you got to have a good physical condition to play because it is a very demanding sport.

Sincerely, I found it very difficult to choose the best film. There are many interesting films with valuable plots and famous actors. Most of them are extremely interesting and worth seeing it. They deserve to be in the top one hundred. But finally I have decided to vote for one of them. My favourite actor is Tom Cruise and consequently the best film I have ever seen was “Far away, far away”, where he plays starring role with his ex-wife Nicole Kidman. I was impressed by the production because of the its valuable plot. The story is about the love between two young people, poor man and rich and beautiful lady, who leaves her family. She wants to try different way of life like the common girls. Both, they pass through a lot of difficulties and lived poor life. The aim of the two personages was to gain a piece of land in America. They have taken part in a competition with riding horses. Only faster competitors was given the land. Of course, our tandem gain a piece of land. The historic context is recreated in the film.\n I recommend you to watch this film and I think you will no regret.\n",

  "text": "Most people in Bali rely too much toward their private vehicles hence they totally abandoned public transportation. We can consider it as the main problem of traffic jam in the island. They say, \"there is no future for public transport, because travelling by car is so much more convenient\". And for me, that's totally non sense. I believe that we can do it here. In order to do that, it will cost us huge transformation. Aside from a great blue-print of a well-organized transportation system, which covers a good 25 to 50 years planning, it also involves local culture. \n\nIt is definitely a hard job to do when we want to change People's culture. A conscience that a change is needed to create a better place for people to live should arise first. People should be reminded that 50 to 100 people travelling in a bus will make the traffic so much better compared to have each two to four of them trap in car, in other words one massive transportation measure against twelve or more cars on the same road. The next is an understanding of what we can do to nature by changing our transportation measure. Imagine the energy that we can keep and pollution that we can stop. We can change, we have to change for a better future. ",

First at all, I want to explain the communication with the town; a lot of people came by train, it is situated at the top of the town, is the best travel to yours because it is the most quickly, but proving that you prefer to come by bus, the bus stop is near the train station.\nThere are many shops around the town, for example we have one that where children can make teddy bears whereas the parents can see them from the restaurant; many children said that it was the best place in the world. \nFor adults we have a little old museum, where you can live one day like sixty years ago,so If you never have been in one, you should go because it is not cost so much, besides the museum has a kinder garden for the kids.\nApart from that the town is near the beach, and there we have many restaurants where you can eat while you are watching the waves on the sea.\nOur personal recommendation is the \"Sir Hotel\" is a muddy hotel because many years ago it had been a castle, as well you can sleep in the king bed and every night it has theatre where you can take a part in a play.\n",

During three years I babisitted my neighbor's two daughters. When I started they were of 3 and 6 years old and I loved to prepare crafts to do with them and usually I had to give them dinner. In addition, the last three years I have been as voluntary in my tennis club, where I have developed different skills to organize activities, sports games and competitions for children from 6 to 14 years old.\nI am an energetic, positive and outgoing person. I enjoy doing whatever kind of sport with my friends. Working with children I have learned to be more patient and moreover I am able to motivating them to do the best of themselves. Also I have gained communicational skills speaking with the children and the families. In order to work in the kitchen I am a really good cook and I used to help my parents every weekend. Finally, although I usually speak Spanish, my second tongue is English. \nWithout doubts I am the person you are looking for and it is a job that I would be very excited to have. \nI look forward to hearing from you,\nSincerely \nSusana.\n",

Besides its advantages are cheap and fast there are many disadvantages of taking bus or train such as time, quality of serving, and crowdedness. it is said that instead of taking public transport, commuters will travel by car because of its convenience. in  my opinion, public transport will be hardly replaced by travelling by car.\nFirst of all, Public transport is used by many people who do not have cars like students and workers. They can afford to buy tickets. For example, my student time, I used to take busses to go to school every day and come back home.\n\nSecondly, The infrastructure in the big cities is not sufficient for all the cars. Traffic jams always happen in the rush hours when there are so many cars on the road. Fossil fuel is running out of resource. It makes the petrol's price increasing every day. It has been affecting to the environment like climate change, increasing droughts , and flooding areas thanks to increasing the demands of using petrol for private cars.\n\nIn conclusion, public transport would be the excellent transportation method for the increasing demands of commuting.

  "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this report is to examine the available local transport usage and possible improvement. Currently, the local transport available are buses and taxis.\nBuses in need of repair\nThe most used public transport is the Bus. The town is covered with more than thirty lines most of them with a duplicate performing the same path on the opposite direction. However, Buses are mostly used by very young people and old people. Children often use them to go to and back from school, and the older population, with increased problems seeing far away, prefer to use the bus to travel around the city. In my opinion, the biggest problem with buses is that they are becoming very degraded, and in desperate need of repair. Most of them don't have air conditioning, meaning that in the summer they are tremendously hot, and some have problems with the windows that cause the bus to be extremely cold in winter.\nThe alternative - Taxis\nFor the average middle-aged person the logical option is to use a taxi. Taxis are available throughout the city, and can be called by a simple phone message. The bad side with taxis is that they are still very expensive, with all the extra taxes and different zones.\nRecommendation\nThere have been rumors of the contruction of a Metro in our town. That would be an excellent alternative to the current means of transportation, since they are fast, aren't affected by traffic, and they are generally cheaper (since they rely on electricity). Another option would be to create a system to rent bicycles; this has been done in many cities with great results.",

  "text": "Hi David,\n\nthat´s amazing, I just wanted to write you an sms and at the same time I´ve received an email from you! It´s great that your college mates want to visit South Bohemia. I love this place so much! I´ll recommend them lots of jewels that could be interesting for them for sure.\n\nFirst of all, if they are staying in České Budějovice, they can spend there at least three days with sightseeing. Anyway they must visit our main square with many historical buildings. They can climb on \"Black Tower\" and listen to singing from the town hall. There is a huge number of shops in the centre so what about doing shopping? Sightseeing in this town is for tourists very convenient because they can reach everything on foot.\n\nIf the weather is nice, they could definitely take a trip to Kleť. It´s the biggest hill where you can go on the lookout tower and it´s not far from České Budějovice. There is an interesting observatory too and what´s more the best restaurant I have ever been in. They must definitely order the best soup in the world. The best way to get there is by car.\n\nČeský Krumlov is worth seeing as well. There´s a pleasant historical centre and a monumental castle placed on the big rock. They can see there 2 brown bears and lots of souvenirs shops too. You can take a bus there.\n\nI hope your friends´ll be satisfied with my tips. If you want to know more about the destination, just write me a message or give me a call.\n\nAll the best, Ivana",

  "text": "The statement given in the rubric proposes an issue of the future of pulic transport in developed countries. I don't agree with this viewpoint due to several reasons.\nFirst of all, vehicles designed to carry large number of people cannot be unnecessary in big cities. Modern megapolises are suffering from surplus of automobiles. It happens not only because of environmental aspect, but mental as well. Regular citizens seem to be tired of eternal traffic jams and yards, filled with parked cars. Thus, it is absolutely possible wish of average person, who spends most of the time in downtown, to replace a car for a bus or an underground. The main reason is general fatigue from the huge number of vehicles around.\nSecondly, taking into account of long-distance trips cannot be avoided. Whatever type of journey you took, you would be more likely to prefer using train or plane, because it would be much more convenient and would not demand any physical tension. Mental one cannot be excluded, but that is the different question.\nOverall, there are a number of causes to disagree with the suggestion, that individual transport is getting more and more popular in comparison with public. The only thing, that definitely should be changed in the future, is an approach to usage of  cars powered by gasoline.",

  "text": "Reflective Writing\n\nI have done to take responsibility for my own learning.\n\nIndependent learning has become an indispensable part of finishing tertiary-level education successfully.  However, traditional teaching method, force-feed the students, has made me overly dependent on teachers in China, which has led me to follow teachers indiscriminately.  Compared with EAP course, it tend to be taken responsibility for finishing assessments independently, especially for academic writing.  Firstly, it was too difficult for me to hand in assessments on time, because I used to spend too much time on playing games without teachers supervision, so that I always did not have enough time for finishing academic assignments independently.  By this trend, I have became a procrastinator finally, which enabled me to face the problems of time management.  In this sense, the term, “time management” means the ability of controlling time on prioritizing tasks, and planning effective scheduling of time to balance study and work, and keeping concentration on motivating yourself to learning towards a goal (Academic Skills Unit, 2012, pp.22-25). \n\nDevelop a strategy in studying is vital.  Rowh (2006) states you will stay up late for accomplishing assessments before the deadline is due without planning in advance.  Therefore, the best way is leaving 30 minutes everyday for reading and beginning to read at once.  Based on examining my actual experience and research, I noticed that a gap, unsuccessful time management in independent learning is the root cause of these problems.  Then I made a few conscious changes that I began to manage duration for finishing my homework ahead of some weeks, as well as stopping procrastinating in the most important areas of my life.\n\nAs an independent learner, it is my sole responsibility to autonomic learning, which is a very important factor in future passing EAP1 successfully, as well as giving me an advantage in terms of coping with the challenges of future Bachelor of Nursing in Australia.\n",

In addition, moderate drinking helps to keep healthy movement, because some researches has shown that people who drink moderately have less proportion of body fat, because alcohol speed up metabolism which makes calories burn quickly. Moreover, it is stated that people who drink moderately have positive social behavior which means that they are more likely to establish contact than non-drinker, and they are more social, popular and they are likely to be married.\n\nOn the other hand, the reading contrast this by mentioning disadvantages of alcohol. Firstly it is stated that alcohol lead to weight gain, because it has more calories per gram than any other drink, and it is mentioned in the passage that you need to walk a mile to lose calories of glass of wine. Furthermore studies have shown that alcohol induce appetite which makes people consume more than they need. For example researchers have found that belly fat is related to alcohol. Second, alcohol can cause some serious health issues, especially cirrhosis of the liver, heart failure, brain damage and variety of cancers. Third, alcohol takers tend to aggression and violence. In fact studies shows that 86 percent of all homicides and 60 percent of sexual assaults, are linked to alcohol\n",

  "text": "  With the development of globalization, there are varieties of impacts for different aspects of daily life. People also have a discussion of its advantages and disadvantages. This essay will describe both positive and negative influences of transportation in China by some examples.\n Firstly, there is a benefit of globalization that people can buy some special products from various countries on the internet instead of buying in the production site. So transportation of goods has become an important link for both the public and businesses. In recent years, there are some different size of logistic companies have been hold, and different modes of transportation has developed rapidly. For example, in the past the main transportations were ships, trains and trucks, so people had to wait long time for their parcels and letters. However, now the increasing number of consumers and logistic companies has chosen airplanes which can save much time to transport their parcels.  \nSecondly, there is still a disadvantage of globalization on transportation in China. The reason is that the development of globalization has let our country improve its economy. However, because of the increasing standard of living, a growing number of people have chosen to travel which has brought a heavy pressure of transportation. So in order to transport a huge number of visitors who are not only foreigners but also native people, the government and experts have to think some different ways to solve this problem. For example, some cities like Beijing and Hangzhou have to limit the number of cars which come for traveling to decrease the pressure of transportation in sight spots and city centre. \n   In conclusion, globalization on the transportation has brought both positive and negative effect to Chinese people. So in my opinion, people need to find right ways to let globalization push the standard of our living whereas discussing its advantages and disadvantages.\n",

Vietnam is a small country but had defeated two big nations which wanted to turn Vietnam into their colony. With strong patriotism, Vietnameses nowadays are trying to develop the nation, to get in the globalization progress. However, as a resident of the country, we can not forget about the history and about our ancestors services rendered to the nation as well as our culture and ideology. As a reward for their efforts. \n Each nation has their own historical places, Vietnam is not an outcast, we also have many historical places which help the younger generations to understand throughout about the past. Those places will help them to take a close look about the root of our nation and learn how to appreciate our culture, custom and tradition. We can mention many places such as Sword Lake, Hỏa Lò prison, Temple of Literature...\n  Today, I will mention about one of the iconic places of Vietnam which you can not miss when travel to Vietnam. It is Temple of Literature, the first university of the nation. Temple of Literature was built in 1070 under the Ly's dynasty. In spite of wars and the destruction of time, Temple of Literature is still preserved in good shape until now. We can still see many ancient structures which show the main trend of architecture at that time. As many other Asian country, in the past, we were greatly influenced by the ideology system of Confucius, a philosopher from China. He built up a system which based on 4 essential relationships in the society. The lessons that scholars at that time were received, most of them were about his ideology. Otherwise, they learned mostly about literature, poetry. \n We can briefly describe the overall structure of Temper of Literature which consists of six parts. Firstly, there were 3 main gates, the center one only for the king, the left side one was for administrators, the right site one was for military. Scholars only could enter by a small gate from aside. Then there are five courtyards from the first one to the fifth one from outside to inside. One remarkable, featured point about Temple of Literature is the people who passed 4 rounds of examination, then gained position titles would be graved their names on the stone grave carried on stone turtles. Right at the moment entering, you can see them from two sides of the courtyards. Temple of Literature is a hollow place for students even now.

Also, you meet a lot of people while you practise sport. This is a relaxing sport because while you are swimming you can think in your life.\n\nOther good point about this sport is that you should move all part of your body. Actually, this sport is very healthy, so some doctors are recomending this type of sport. You can do different sports on the pool for example: swimming, water aerobics, Olympic diving or diving.\n\nIf you begin to practise this sport, you should wear goods snorkeling glasses and you should warm up five minutes before you get into the pool. Besides, you can have could shower after and before that you do swimming, this is good because your body temperature is hotter than the water of the pool and if you get into the pool very fast you can have a problem with your body temperature.\n",

  "text": "Topic:  Mt.Fuji\n\nIn Japan, there are many interesting places to visit.  For example, Kyoto is a popular place to visit because it has a lot of invaluable temples.  Sapporo is an attractive place because raw fish and vegetables are fresh and nice to eat.  Among these places, Mt.Fuji is the most wonderful place in Japan because its scenery is so beautiful, it is a popular place and it offers several exciting activities.\n\nThe first reason is Mt.Fuji has very beautiful scenery.  For instance, in winter, Mt.Fuji changes to a white face by snow.  The white Mt.Fuji is very beautiful, so it has been the subject of countless works of art such as the 'Thirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji', a series of “ukiyo-e” paintings by Hokusai.  Also, in summer, almost all the snow on Mt Fuji melts and it changes to brown and green colors.  At a summer sunset, Mt.Fuji is so majestic that many pictures and paintings have been done of Mt.Fuji at sunset.      Depending on the season, Mt.Fuji makes various beautiful sights and it always fascinates many people.\n\nThe second reason is that Mt.Fuji is a popular mountain.  People who come here are so many.  A lot of travelers and climbers come to climb the mountain and more than 200,000 people climb to the top of Mt.Fuji in a year.  In addition, many cameramen and painters come to record the beautiful landscape of Mt.Fuji.  Also, many observers of weather, stars or space come here, since this is an important place to observe weather, stars and space.\n\nThe last reason is that Mt.Fuji offers several exciting leisure activities.  Climbing to the top of Mt.Fuji is allowed in late July and August.  To climb to the mountaintop is not easy because the height is more than 3,700 meters.  However, numerous climbers come to experience seeing the very beautiful view such as the exquisite rising sun from Mt.Fuji.  Besides, a marathon takes place ever year.  This marathon is very hard due to severe conditions of low oxygen and a steep slope, so people who are proud of strong body try this marathon.  Furthermore, around Mt.Fuji, there are five beautiful lakes and many hot springs.  These offer a camping, fishing, cruising, and taking a hot spring bathing with a nice view. \n\nEnjoying an activity with a nice view is relaxing to people.  Japan has a lot of good places for relaxing, but the best place is Mt.Fuji.  Mt.Fuji has beautiful scenery, it is popular and it offers exciting activities for people.  Mt.Fuji will continue to give wonderful impression to many people forever.\n",

  "text": "Story\nThe doorbell ran. When I opened the door imagine my surprise as there was nobody standing. NO one at all.I could only feel a hot, smelly stream of wind. ‘There must have been a naughty child’ I thought without worrying. Later on the week I was doing the dishes when the kitchen door suddenly opened  for no reason however I felt the same hot wind in my face and the same funny smell. That was when I first started to believe that something wrong was happening at home. The next time it happened to me such a thing I felt no wind but this particular stink. It was as if somebody was cooking some cauliflower. At that time I was unemployed so I wasn't able to move house and as I wasn't afraid of it I had to put up with those strange events.So I decided not to pay any attention to it and carry on with my normal life. \n\nNow I have to admit that I have a problem I am sharing home with a ghost or two but I don´t mind as long as he or she leaves me alone.\n",

For this reason I have been doing three courses during this year. These are quite interesting and have helped me to know deeper children's pleasures. I have learnt a lot of activities which let them have fun at the same time they get in touch with nature.\nI am able to cook some delicious dishes too. My grandmothers used to run a restaurant and she taught me some Italian recipes. I have to practise more, but I think I am qualified enough to do this activity.\nI am available all summer so I could start to work whenever you would need to.

  "text": "Good afternoon. My name is John, I'm twentynine years old and I live in Romania. This month on the 9'th I'm going to have an oral and writing examination on my English language knowledge. The English language is a foreign language for me, but I have studied it for ten years and hopefully I will manage to pass the exam. I am particularly concerned about my speaking skills and I hope I will not be so nervous in front of the teachers. The exam is assumed to be on professional matter. Subjects like passport, travel document, third country citizen, inhuman treatment or punishment will be the main criteria to the exam. I have three more days to prepare myself better, but to be honest I'm not in the mood of studying. I'm going to travel all the way to the capital of my country, approximately three hundred and fifty kilometres. I called a girl who is a colleague of mine from another airport. She said she will join me for the exam. In fact she will also participate in the exam. Hopefully I will pass the exam and will attend the English course for a month. Afterwards I will have the right to take part to the intarnational missions for maintaining the peace under the patronage of the European Union. I wish to come back happier.",

  "text": "Report: How Budapest takes care of its environment?\n\nIt's very hard to organise a big city's rubbish delivery system and to keep the city clean.\nIn connection with the first issue, Budapest completes the task very well. In Budapest the rubbish is collected separetely. In the new buildings there are usually dustbins for each material (glass, plastic, etc.), and around the older buildings there are more and more separate dustbins. So, almost everybody, who lives in Budapest, has the chance to use this form of rubbish collection.\nIt would be logical that we recycle the garbage as much as possible, and there are factories, where they use this technique, but in Budapest we usually don't use much recycled goods recently. And it is a serious problem, because in the not so distant future we won't be able the handle the garbage-it won't be enough space where we could deposit that.\nAn another (one could say the most) important question about a capital city is: how clean is it? In that area Budapest accomplishes very awful. In spite of the number of the cleaners, the town is dirtier than Vienna or Prague. Naturally it's mainly depends on us: if we could put our garbage into the dustbin, instead of letting it on the streets, it would be easier to keep it clean. However, it wouldn't be impossible to collect the rubbish and clean the streets more often-it's just a matter of organisation.",

  "text": "The fact that \"shopping is not always enjoyable\" might be considered an universal truth.\n\nAlthough it is true that shopping might not be a very interesting topic, it must be stated that it is necessary. There are many different kinds of shopping: e.g. clothes, groceries, furniture, instruments, etc. It all depends on what you are about to buy.\n\nWhen it comes to clothes there are also different kinds of people, the ones who do it for necessity and the ones who do it for joy. The former might not be so enjoyable whilst the latter, obviously, does it for enjoyable purposes.\n\nGroceries and furniture, as well as instruments, follow the same pattern. It all depends on the type of person buying it, their personality and a wide range of other characteristics which will not be covered now.\n\nIn last place, it is undoubtedly influenced by the place in which you are buying (i.e. the room, the organization, the prices, the distance, etc) and the unknown people who are in it which may cause trouble or facilitate your shopping and make it more enjoyable. These factors will be explained in another occasion.\n\nIn conclusion, shopping might be both: enjoyable or not. In order for it to happen, a range of different variables have to take place.",

  "text": "Although there are a lot of people who strongly believe the best way of travling around the city is by motorbike, there is also a big part of the society who is sure it has too many drawbacks to be worth buying one.\n\nOwning a motorbike has advantages. One very important positive aspect is that, thanks to the small amount of petrol it needs, the keeping of a motorbike is considerably economical. In addition, as it is smaller than a car, parking becomes much less complicated. Besides, for the same reason, it is easier to avoid traffic jams.\n\nOn the other hand, motorbikes do also have drawbacks. For example, the lack of safety, which raises the probabilities of getting hurt if an accident occurs.                                                                                 Another disadvantage this kind of vehicle has is the low number of passengers who can travel on a motorbike consequently not everybody finds it convenient or comfortable owning one.\nIn conclusion, owning a motorbike can be useful or useless depending on the lifestyle you have, your economic status, and the number of people you need to travel with.

  "text": "Have you ever been in trouble, which type of transport you should take? I was, too! \nLet's imagine: you can choose between plane, train and boat. If you must come a long way, then you'll probably opt for travelling by plane... It's a good idea, but... I've got an aviophobia! It makes my every journey unpleasnt and I feel uneasy all the week before the flight. But excluding cases like mine: flying is the fastest, the most safe and often the cheapest way to travel.\nWe can take a trip by boat. But this mode of transport isn't so comfortable, esspecialy when we must travel onshore, then it's complicated because travelling by boat is allowed only by the sea or any sizeable river, which courses are usually placed less conveniently than roads or even railway tracks.\nIn that case it indicates that my favourite way to travel is train! For me it has some very important advantages, like that you don't stand in traffics, reductions for students, low risk of accidents, potentiality of sleeping, eventuality of travelling with bike or other big luggage. Most railway lines are quite spruce and for me, travelling by train is pleasure!\nIn my opinion, everything depending on our preferences, but train is general-purpose means of transport, I recommend it!\n",

At first, I'm not interested in it, since I didn't any idea how to play, as I had only played basketball and volleyball, however, I didn't enjoy these two at all. Moreover, I also didn't like to do exercise which was tired and my strength was extremely weak that every time when measure 800 kilometers I always ranked the last three. But when I decided to sit aside and chatted with my friends, one of my male friends, who has still kept in touch at present, asked me to play together. After he got the reason why I didn't have any desire to play, he told me to give myself a try, and if I still didn't like it, he would't force me. Then, he taught me how to play, for example, when hitting, used the strength of the whole arm and did not just used elbow, or you would feel tired shortly.\n  While playing, I rejoiced at this exercise, because I have never sweated so much and felt refreshed before. The funniest thing to me was that I thought I were a kid who studied kindergarten for the way he taught. When hitting ball back successfully, he would say ''good, keep going or you did it''. Hitting ball again and again, I learned I loved badminton unconsciously, which not only includes running but also concentrating.\n  Badminton is an easy sport that everyone can try , just focus on ball and hit it back. In addition, before playing, must warm up your body and relax your muscle after playing in case suffered injuries.",

Cooking for my family is one of my hobbies, and I am therefore fond of finding different kinds of food. In addition, having been equipped with my rather good English-speaking skills and cross-cultural communication skills obtained during the working time as a receptionist for a Canadian mining company, I feel very confident and amicable while dealing with customers. Last but not least, I am willing to work for long hours if required.

  "text": "The world where we live now is more suitable for young people, as many could say and prove, even though, in some countries, older people can have a decent life without depending on young people. Unfortunately, the reality impels me to admit that young people has more opportunities to enjoy life because of all the technological advance that older people tend to not understand well. Also, because of the fact that the urbanization have not helped most countries to adapt the cities into places more accessible to senior people.\n\nThe new technologies are something that we cannot love without anymore. But, unfortunately, the new gadgets can be very difficult to manage or master, especially for the part of the population who did not learn about them while they were children or students at the university (older people). I am one of the fortunate people who was born on the technological era, which means that I have had access to computers, gps and mobiles, for example, since I was a little child. The technological equipment help me in my daily life in a way that I can no longer travel or even commute in my city without them. The fact that these utensils are familiar for youth make them helpful and useful. On the other hand, to someone who did not have these when they were more young and active, such as grandmothers and grandfathers, the new instruments are just things that they cannot use nor understand. The older people are limited in their abilities to use technology that could be valuable to provide enjoyable times at home, on the street, in a museum, etc.\n\nAnother transformation, which is corollary from the advances that humanity have been seeing lately, is the modification in the cities and our living habits. Since last century, the world population is more present in the bigger cities, which, as a result, have been increasing in size and in problems. The urbanization implemented by government across the decades in the cities are sometimes not suitable for all public. For instance, older people or the ones with disabilities have great difficult to use the metro system because of the number of stairs. My mother is a perfect study of case for me because she cannot well the transportation system in Paris or New York without been lost and very tired from all the walking that she has to do when commuting. The mobility of older people is certainly reduced if compared with a younger person. Sometimes, the lack of solutions to the reduced capacity of movement around on big cities compels the older population to stay at home. In this case, they do not have the possibility to go out and enjoy the benefits that cities may bring to their lives.\n\nTherefore, the new technologies and the transformation in the cities are very beneficial for the younger part of the population who is capable of understanding how to manage the modern instruments and use all kinds of transportation. On the other hand, for the older people, the modernisation that we experience is an obstacle for them to enjoy all that there are out there.\n",

The process of becoming this fact real and common in our society began about 100 years ago and what is really absorbing, nearly 95 percent of advanced society cannot imagine the world without any kind of information about famous people and their existence at all. The question is if it is good to take a leaf out of their book and I am going to talk around it.\n\tIt is good to have your unique value system, but the stories about people who have been doing good affects you and your future decisions. Probably if you hear about heroic attitude you will be able to do without doubts something magnificent as well. In this way I think that is good to look up to some celebrities who are righteous. The second thing is that if you are in trouble you’ll feel better than usual because of well-known dramas based on factual stories which happened to the famous people. How the English say: better the devil you know.\n\tThere are dangers which appear because of overthinking about stars and comparing yourself to them – it is called low self-assessment. Even if you would like to be up to date with the latest news from celebrities’ private life and professional career you have to remember that the media distorts reality. If something isn't catchy will not catch the poeple attention. The press editors often alter details thereupon they get selling well material. If you believe that the media says true you are wrong.\n\tTo sum up, I believe that it is really important to strike a balance and keep it during your whole life. Of course you can look up to the celebrities but you have to be aware of the consequences. Each kind of guiding light help us, but the most important is to choose the right and accurate person.",

  "text": "        phenomenon of homeless people became a serious problem and many countries cannot solve this problem. The number of these people is increasing not just in the developing countries but all over the world. In my opinion, homeless people are victims because nobody wants to live without a shelter.\n\n        First of all, being without home is a horrible problem. One of the major reasons for this problem is wars especially in the Arab countries like Syria, Libya and Yemen.Everyday on news We see the refugees who are in a miserable condition.They live in tents that do not protect them of cold weather or dangerous insects. They do not have enough food.In addition , financial crisis ,almost of the  companies has a financial problem so the ideal solution for them is downsizing. After a while the people who are laid off will not have enough money to live ,and they will become homeless people.Furthermore, children street  is a result of families troubles.Cases of divorce are increasing and many children escape and prefer to live in the street instead of home full of problems.  \n\n      As opposed to the idea above, some people believe that homeless people are criminals and they cause danger on our society because they need money and food so they can steal or kill for this.\n\n    To conclude, the world has a complicated issue,so The governments and the charitable organization must take a quick decision and put a real solution to solve this problem.The homeless people are human beings and they must take their rights in life.\n\n",

Your position. To ski well you need do push your body forward. It should be a strait line trough your toes, knees and shoulders. You need to use your muscles in your stomach to stay in the right position. Another thing that is important is the angle. The body parts that help you to get a big angle is your toes, knees, hips and shoulders. \nA turn starts with your toes, and then your knees and then your hips. \nWhen you start training in course you need to think about were you turn. You should do the turn before the stick so you can start next turn right after you pass the stick. \n\nThe best thing with this sport is the feeling. The wind blowing in your hair, the speed and that you have control of what is happening. It also fun because you can notice that you are getting better all the time.  ",

  "text": "The urban myth that statues could move makes the contemporary people frightened. And the Doctor Who, Sci-Fi TV series of BBC, exteriorized this terror from the Weeping Angels. They appeared first in Blink, one of the Doctor Who episodes. After Blink was broadcasted, it raised common fears about statues to tele-viewers in Britain and over the world. According to the recent polls in 2007 and 2012 carried out by the British magazine, Radio Times, the Weeping Angels were picked as the most scariest villain of the Doctor who twice by about half of respondents. These results are interesting because Weeping Angels are not the old adversaries of Doctor, like the Daleks exterminating all organic and inorganic things in the whole universe or the Cybermen transforming all living things into cyborg.\nThen, what makes the Weeping Angels frightening? To figure out the factors, uncanny theory is used. Uncanny theory explains an uncomfortable sensation originated from perceiving something familiar as unfamiliar. This weird feeling is especially caused by experiencing something dead or non-living as life-likeness. In Blink, Weeping angels’ uncanny traits and awkward backgrounds in the drama make audience have a scary and unfamiliar sensation.\nIt is hard to read the Weeping Angels’ thoughts and emotions from their ash-pale face. They look unnatural, in spite of their similar appearances with human. Usually, they tend to hide their face, since angels could not move free when they watch each other. And expressions in their eyes are completely lacklustre, due to the deficiency of pupil. Also, their facial expressions are almost flat as dead pans. These factors make angels more grotesque psycho-pass assassin. Then, it seems that these statutes might lose their spirits, only when they got our gaze.\nBy the way, the exterior traits of Weeping Angels are not enough to make people scared. But when it comes to their interior factor, the uncanny feelings are maximised by turning unconscious physiological reaction into conscious one. The angels move and attack free, only when people blink their eyes or turn around their sight away. However, people blink their eyes several times a minute and they are hardly aware of blinking. After the Doctor’s warning, they may not turn our back, look away, and blink as we are protagonists of the episode. Because it seems like, if we do that, angels will come out from TV and attack us! Then, strangely, blinking our eyes becomes conscious behaviour.\nMoreover, there are good scene settings to make people not blink by immersing audience in that situation. In several scenes, Weeping Angels, the lonely assassins, never shift their positions and postures, even though protagonists and supporting players blink, look away or turn their backs. Why do they not move, even if their prey is near? The reason is that TV viewers watch them simultaneously. To change the pose of the horrific statues technically, directors hide the angels by actors closing and opening the door or conceal the angels behind the actors through panning cameras horizontally, for a moment. At last, directors fade out the scenes flicking out the light bulb in basement for maximizing the threat of Weeping Angels!\nAt last, Blink fills people with dread about the circumstances they live in by feeling unfamiliar. After Sally, the heroine of Blink, takes the TARDIS key away from Weeping Angels in the deserted house, they shadow her quietly, as if they might be laid there for a long time.

  "text": "In Japan, there are many rules are set in the Sento. They are usually aiming to avoid the hygienic problems. Potential issues such as rule violation and conflicts may be arose because the foreigners may not understand the rules. \nJapanese, as pointed out by Trompenaars (cited in Morrison , 2006), is highly influenced by the values of universalism. Similarly, the high level of uncertainly avoidance and the low level of indulgence (Hofstede 1994) cause the Japanese society seems to be obedient and self-disciplined. The main reason for Japanese that they always follow the rules is to respect and hope not to cause any confusion to other users. Also, Japanese think highly of the enjoyment of bathing in a clean environment. As a result in Australia, conflicts may be caused due to the high level of indulgence and individualism in Australian culture (Hofstede 1994), people may usually emphasize in their self-satisfaction and think of themselves first instead of the public. They may not consider the public interest and not give precedence to other users. Consequently, the bathing pool may face the hygienic problems, such as someone does not wash before bathing , and scrambling issues.\n\nIn order to achieve cost efficiency, the choice of locations and decor must be thoroughly considered. A location whether it has sufficient quantity of water or not is the essential consideration. Rental cost is also a limitation as it is relatively higher in Australia. ",

  "text": "Dear John,\nI am writing to recommend a place you should definitely visit while you're in Poland. The place I'm writing about is Wawel Royal Castle in Cracow. It is not only one of the most important monuments in the whole country but also a beautiful place to visit. It is a majestical castle conviniently located on the river. It's a huge breath-taking complex of historical buildings and royal gardens. The place is fascinating, because it is loaded with history and nice to spend a day and relax in royal gardens. I also recommend going to the vaults under the cathedral, where since the 16th century many kings and famous Polish people have their graves. The Wawel Royal Castle is an obligatory place to see, while visiting Poland. It is well known in the whole of Europe and many foreigners are coming to Poland just to see the Cracow city and among other things the Wawel Castle. I also thoroughly recommend Cracow in general as a place to visit, because it is beautiful, full of other worth-seeing monuments, cute small cafes, various choice of restaurants and vivid hotels with great views on the riverside. I hope you will describe your impressions about the city after visiting it. I'm looking forward to a response from you.\n\nYours faithfully",

I think it is time we start taking environmentally friendly attitudes to help the planet.\n\nFirst of all, as dioxides and carbons gases have been increasing ozone pollution worldwide in big cities, awareness campaigns should be promoted to highlight the alternative usages of transportation. Also, the adoption of bicycles and walking, for instance, seems to be a responsible attitude to the planet.\n\nIn addition, water pollution is, as well, a global problem, as so many industries dump a large amount of waste into rivers and lakes and also human waste and rubbish end up in the water. A solution could be done by improving recycling, waste disposal and even, by cleaning up shorelines.\n\nMoreover, life may not be possible for the future generations, unless we start from now using renewable sources of energy, like green, to promote sustainability and improve energy efficiency avoiding side effects to the planet.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that we can reduce damages and global warming by adopting environmentally friendly attitudes, as the use of green and clean energy sources. \n\n",

Now that we have a wonderful idea I thought you would want to hear about it.I know how much you care about animals and love them, especially dogs. The problem is that there are lots of stray dogs in the streets and they disturb people.\n\nWe decided to organize a play and donate the money we earn to a Dog Foundation. We tried to involve many students as possible since we needed actors, costume designers and technicians. Thanks to this event, people have learned to work as a team,improved their self-esteem and developed their social skills.\n\nThe event was very successful as we earned €2,000 in just a day.

On the other hand, aside from my bedroom, I would love to have my own reading nook, where to read peacefully. So, if my mental estimates are correct, there should still be enough  space available to also place a little armchair, where I could read more comfortably than in my bed or in my chair desk, not very far from the window. Oh!, also, it would be really nice to have a footstool, too.\n\nAs far as television is concerned, well, being honest, I haven't been watching much TV for years. So, at most, I would put on a fourteen inches one on the top of one of the bookcases. Nevertheless, it's something dispensable for me and, for this reason, I think I could get by without having one.\n\nNow that I have already finished describing the arrangement of my hypothetical bedroom, I am going to talk about its lighting. Firstly, I would only use energy-saving lights to illuminate my dream room. Secondly, my idea is putting on, at least initially, two lamps: a white overhead one and a red desk one. Regarding the desk is just beside the bed, the desk lamp could be used to illuminate both the desk and the bed head; that way, placing another lamp in the furniture would be unnecessary . Lastly, I could consider also putting on a standard lamp near my reading armchair, but I would need to actually set up and use my dream bedroom to see if it is really worth it. \n\nFinally, concerning the bedroom colours, I believe the walls should be painted of a light colour, like white, beige or, maybe a light green. The ceiling could be the same colours as the walls or, perhaps, a darker hue than they. I sincerely doubt that I painted the furniture, though, so they would display the colour of the wood they would be made from. Lastly, I would like that my curtains were red, given that is my favourite colour; however, I would use maroon, which is quite similar, for the curtains because it is more sober and, consequently, more suitable for my room.",

  "text": "I completely disagree with the statement \"there is no future for public transport\". I do believe that with time people become more conscious of the idea of cities convenient to everyone. Despite private car is more convenient to its owner then public transport, it is not in use the majority of time and that means wasting city space for parking while it could be used as a public space. At the same time it is not impossible to solve the task of comfort and efficacy simultaneously. For instance network of taxi cabs with affordable prices could combine comfort of personal car and work-load of public transportation. Nowadays all the car manufacturers accepted the task of design robot-driven car that in future would resolve the issue of safety and availability of taxi 24 hours 7 days a week. But how is it possible to persuade citizens to make a right choice? Unfortunately the main method is to make private cars if not a luxury then to make their usage economically less efficient in favour to public transportation. And underground, light tram system are still more ecological and fast.",

When we came the manager gave the tickets to us and told us to be nice. We stood in the entrance and when the clock struck six there just appeared thousands of people. It doesn´t seem but it was hard work but after the concert the manager praised us for doing good job. And guess what was the best thing about it! We could watch the concert without buying a ticket! You can imagine that it was amazing, Linkin Park is the best group I know so I was really enjoying it. \nI hope we will get this chance next year. Do you think you will go with us next time?

  "text": "     I do not agree with the statement that there is no future for public transport. In recent years, public transport is really common in our lives. From the Metro system, the bus, the train, and the high speed rail, all these public transportation become more and more popular. Lots of people really enjoy the moment when taking public transportation because they are more convenient, cost less and more eco-friendly.\n     In my opinion, taking public transport is more convenient. We don't have to drive by ourselves, and we don't have to think which way we should go to reach the destination. What we have to do is simply go to the public transport stations and there will be vehicles that will take us to anywhere we want.\n     Additionally, taking public transport cost less. Compared to driving a car, it only cost us about 20 N.T. dollars or at most 50 dollars for one single travel. We have to pay for the oil if we drive and we all know that the oil price goes up every year. As a result, I think more people will prefer to take public transport rather than driving due to the high price of the oil.\n     Finally, taking public transport is more eco-friendly. Our mother earth has suffered from air pollution for a long period of time which leads to greenhouse effect and the rise of the average sea level. We don't want these natural disorders to continue. Taking public transport can effeciently reduce the emmission of carbon dioxides and will help the earth to recover from those disorders. So, as a member living in our mother earth, we should do our best to protect her. From this point of view, I don't think public transport has no future.\n     The above reasons I mentioned explain why I do not agree with the statemant that the public transport ha no future because travelling by car is more convenient.",

  "text": "Learning of another language is very useful these days, because of globalization and also cooperation between countries. It is importatnt when we work or study in international area.\n\nIt can have benefits but also some drawbacks. Firstly I would like to write about benefits. People who are learning another language or more languages have more opportunities in their life. It can have influence at their work. They can have better position, work for foreign company, communicate with foreign companies etc. It can be the benefit at school as well, because if you need some information for some project, you can look at foreign literature too. Also you can be part of travelling and working experience which can offer to you your school. If you want to try this option, you need to have a very good level of particular language. It is very good that these days schools offer you more languages for learning to choose from and they recommend learning at least 2 foreign languages. Of course it can be different in each country. Another very important benefit of learning new language is that you can travel you will understand people abroad and you will know how to communicate with them. It helps you to ask people on many important information which you need during your journey. For example, which way you should go, where is good restaurant, how to travel in a country, how to solve your problems, where is the cheapest accommodation and much more. Thanks of learning another language you can have also friends from  all the world and you can better understand the culture of new country.\n\nAnd what are the drawbacks?\nI think that there is not many disandvantages of learning another language. One of them can be that people who do not understand this language will try to ask you all the time to help them. It can be really interrupting if it still continues. And sometimes maybe you do not want to hear what are people speaking about in foreign language.\n\nIn conclusion I would like to say that the learning of another language will be always important for today´s people and new generation too and in addition it will increase need to communicate in another language.\n",

The scenery, the beauty of mountain and river,can only be enjoyed when you travel there on youe own.Once I visited the museumm finding some pictures of the cave painting in France,but when I got France to see the real painting,I found it is more vivid and can show you how great the France caveman who painted it.\n\nAdmittedly,the museum has its owm merits;it is easy to find on the map and always be emphazised as a symbol of a country. However,more often than not,the high price of the ticket of the museum can ruin the fun when you get to the coutry.A documentary,a book about the culture is cheap and easy.we can consider it a ecomomical method.\n\nVisiting museum is undoubtedly a good way to konw about a country,but not a best way anymore. If you decide to find some information about a totally unknowed land,the museum is not a wise option.\n \n",

  "text": "The home of the future. That sounds a little bit like a name of any sci-fi or horror. But why? Will our houses look so terrible in a 40 years? Will they fly in the sky? Or will they be made from iron and have strong door and barred windows? Will we even go out on the street? But don't panic, let's think rationally. Technology will control our homes. With technology we will clean our house, technology will  protect us, with technology we will spend our free time. In every room we will have a big screen, where we'll be able to see, where are our children and if everything's ok. Our fridge will tell us to buy a fresh milk, if there's no left. Our bed will tell us when to go sleep. I have only one question. Will we live in that house alone? Do we need friends or family members if technology can take care of us? Machines can tell us lots of imporatant information. Does it mean that contact between people will disappear? I think it's something nobody wants, but it can comes true. People use machines and robots because they don't want to waste their time. But maybe they could stop talk to each other, because it's waste of time too. I hope, It will never happen. Better live in a cottage. ",

  "text": "    Summer camping is all about providing fun activity in a safe environment. Working with kids  makes fun and safety a high priority. In my opinion, to be a suitable person for the summer camp job you should have qualifications to create fun activities and to keep kids safe.\n\n  Creating fun activities is an important role of the summer camp workers. As a father of three boys and one girl aged 7-10 years, I have the ability to create and perform fun activities.In the last summer, my kids and I created a fun morning and afternoon program for our neighbors we called it \"multi-balls multi-fun\". In the morning program, the kids have enjoyed playing football, soccer ball, basketball and water ball. The program has included many competitive activities  that full of fun and cheerful. In the afternoon, the kids have enjoyed a multi-dance program that has different international dances. the kids have loved learning new dances and cultures \n\n   Safety is a core component in the summer camps' activities. while designing fun activities, the camp workers have to take in concerns the safety level for these activities, the possible harm and the protection and treatment supplies that might be needed.  As a retired nurse, I have a high sense of safety and harm prevention. I used to assess and treat many injured kids during my work journey in many hospitals.In addition, I have the experience in providing the basic,  the advanced life support, and the airway protection. While these situations are rare, they need an effective fast intervention to save kids' lives.\n\n   In conclusion, I think providing fun in safe environment is the main component in summer camp that each family is looking for. as a father and a nurse I have the ability to create the fun, to provide safe activities and the most important is my ability to intervene in the emergency situations ",

  "text": "Yes. We can get a lot of up to date information around the world through watching television. There are many channels on TV, not only entertainment but also technology, health, environment, weather forecast and news channel,etc. So, it can really educate people. News on TV tell us what is happening in the world. Health channels give the ways of living with healthy lifestyle. Weather forecast points out to prevent from violent storm,rain,snow,etc. Discovery channel is the knowledge bank and animal planet is very interesting. Moreover, nowadays many education channels are developing to help the students. Mathematics, English and environmental knowledge Quiz programs on TV aid the mental development of children. We can also improve our moral attitude by watching the discussion and speech by the outstanding leaders. So, I think advantages and disadvantages of TV mainly depend on the watching person. We can make good use of time from TV and we can also waste time with some useless channels.So, we need to try to get equal balance between entertainment and education from TV.

  "text": "Tom was so happy because he finally won the prize. He attended in a local motorcycle race and won the 5000 $ cash prize. He did his best for this race. Three consecutive years he attended in the local race but at most he could get the second rank. This year he found a good trainer and 6 months training made him fully ready for this race. He went to coffee shop. In there he saw an old man who asked him for help. The old man said to him my son needs surgery today or he will die. Tom asked him the cost of surgery. The old man answered 20,000 $. Tom asked him about the insurance and the old man said the insurance only pays 5,000 according to its commitment for this kind of disease. Tom told I can give you 5000$ but what can I do for the rest of this amount? He thought I should perform a show to jump over the several wrecked cars but it was too risky because he had not any experience in this kind of show. Moreover, he needs some people to advertise for the show. He talked to his trainer Jack and explained the problem. Jack said I know someone who can do that but how we organize the show. We need advertising and to find a suitable place for show until 3 pm. Tom called his friends and asked them to advertise by any means they can and also he requested his trainer to talk to the owner of the race road. It was 5 pm and too many people came to see the show. Tom yelled: ladies and gentlemen, please help us as much as you can because all of the income of this show is paid for surgery of a sick boy. Tom sold all of tickets quickly and earned enough money. The old man became very excited and glad. His son was cured and in recovery room Tom visited him and they became friends. It was 10 pm when Tom arrived home. Although it had been a very long and tiring day, but Tom felt he had achieved something really good.                                                 ",

Our curiosity is not restraining. I want to give an example how would look like the Home of the Future.\nThe first question is where our homes would be located. Will it be Earth in general? There are a lot of places where people are setting theirs houses, perhabs we will be living under water? Many buildings like skycarpers are suggesting living in flats which exist above the ground and it is not extraordinary, but how about whole cites prospering under the water with it own source of light which could replace the Sun.\nLikewise location, something which could change are the materials with which we will build houses. Our main goal should be creating homes with renewable materials which might be available to everyone and cheap. That way of thinking could bring us a better world without homeless people.\nDespite the fact that visual aspect is the most important thing to most people in my opinion in this case everything was said and no new forms could be created. \nTo summarize the Home of the Future will bring us not only a new kind of home, but also a new outlook on life.\n",

  "text": "Good morning, everyone! Today I’m going to introduce a book about nature that I’ve read recently. The book is called “Living Through a Natural Disaster” written by Eve Recht. The reason I chose this book was that it is really comprehensive in showing you that different parts of the world are suffering from disasters, for instance, the Cyclone Tracy in Darwin, Australia ；the Yellow River flood in China and a devastating drought in Central America etc. It concisely depicts the devastation and destruction caused by natural disasters. The book is also very readable, not only introducing the disastrous effects of disasters but simply gives us an overview of handling natural disasters, so anyone can get to know the geographical phenomenon.\n  The most engaging and intriguing part of this book is that the people who live along the Yellow River, how they suffered from the flood and how they handled the devastation and make a better solution. At the beginning, the Yellow River was always unleashing terrible floods that swept through towns, villages and farmland. It became a mass killer and make people homeless. People were forced to flee by boat because of the flood. People living along the river wanted to prevent the flood coming again by building dykes. However it made the situation worse. After day of heavy rain, the water level became dangerously high because the riverbed cannot withstand the water when it out of its limitation. The Yellow River overflows and the crops on the plains are ruined in some areas .Fortunately, the flood also makes the plains fertile and feed millions of people.\n  While I was flip-flopping through the pages, I let my imagination run wild with the story. Let’s think about how we treated our mother of nature before. Now she is extremely angry after human beings did something really hurt to her. After all ,she is very kind-hearted and always helps us have a good living. Even though the mother of nature is complicated sometimes, she would give us a light of hope. She never just shuts one door, and she also opens another one.\n  According to what Charles Dickens said, ”it was the best of times”, because the people can get rewarding from the nature and get a better life because of the fertile land which can feed us. However, “it was the worst of times” also. People will continue suffering the dangerous floods and there is no end after many years unless the government take an effective action to stop flooding. It is arduous for people living in devastating surroundings. The Yellow River is a combination of history and modernization. It carries a lot of memories from the past to now, whether it is cruel to people or not.\n  Reading this book is like unwrapping a present which is packed in layers of sheets. My heart grieved at every word portraying the suffering of the people in the Yellow River. Meanwhile, a surge of sympathy and despair overwhelmed me with lots of thought-provoking words. I sincerely recommend this book to everybody who wants to broaden their horizons and know more than you have known already.\n  That’s all for my presentation today. Thank you for listening!\n",

  "text": "I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity. In this essay, I will think about the effects of these popular sporting events.\nThe World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, North and South Korea are two countries against each other, but every year they still have a friendly football match. During that time, the fans and the players are the same harmony in unity and friendship. The fans, supporters shout, they even cry together. The sports game events are opportunities to strengthen the friendship between the nations.\nOn the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. Sometimes the sports games are full of tensions over flow. The patriotic emotions explode in unaggressive way. For example, during the semi-final first leg AFF Cup 2014 between Vietnam and Malaysia team, the players played quite violent, the supporters of the two teams were very tense. Even after the end of the match assaults occurred between supporters of the two teams.\nI think that international sporting occasions can be one of the best ways to ease tensions or to release patriotism safely. However, I believe that games cannot be the fundamental ways for the sound patriotism or peaceful international relations. \n",

  "text": "Nowadays it is possible to listen to  various types of music. What is the reason for making music necessary for us? Is national music more important than foreign music, which is heard all over the world? Taking acceptance the strength of music, it is hard to imagine human life without it.  \"Music is the nutrition for our souls\" said in the popular proverb. Therefore, we can feel the enormous role of music in our lives. \nTo my mind, beautifulness of music does not depend on its sorts. People enjoy it and do not think about its genre. For example, there are various music competitions Eurovision Song Contest which organized in many countries. People almost from all over the world attends to participate in it. \nBeing the core of culture of a country, it influences on national fame. For instance, in our country music consists of two main parts: Mougam and Folk music, which have been getting popularity from all regions in the world since it was sprung. However, modern music is not always acceptable for different people. Despite that it is held by the majority of countries.  To take account that it has been improving day by day, we can meet the appearance of very exotic and amazing mixtures of modern and national music almost in every country.  Most of the countries enjoy such intertwining that could be considered as a new type of music.

She is pretty, smart and so nice for all people. And for now she is one of the most popular models in the world not only in the school.

  "text": "Dear Jo,\n\nI´m very happy for reading your letter and that you come to my beautiful country.\n\nI think that Spain is an incredible country since it has all kinds of landscapes: mountains, beaches, lakes, and you can enjoy adventure activivities, for example, trekking routes, climbing, bungee, surf... You can make different tourism depending on the city where you want to go.\nFirst of all, I would like to talk about Extremadura. Extremadura is in the West of Spain and it has a good weather all year. However, I recommend travelling to Extremadura in Spring or Autumm because in summer it is too hot. In Extremadura you can enjoy the environment and you can walk across the famous Monfragüe Nacional Park or Tajo-International Natural Park. Moreover, you can swim in the cold water of Los Pilones (I recommend you this place because it is an incredible and quiet place and I love it) or small natural lakes on the North of Extremadura. Also, Extremadura has many towns and cities with an impressive ancient neighbourhood, for instance, Cáceres, Mérida, Trujillo, Guadalupe, Alcántara...\n\nOther places that I would recommend are: the towns of the South of Andalucia which have clean beaches, cold water and a good leisure with many restaurants, shops, parks, zoos, aquatic parks... \nOn the other hand, near Mediterranean Sea there are a lot of towns with fantastic beaches which water is very clean and warm. In particular, I recommend you to go to Baleares Islands. However, if you want to go there, you must fly or go by ship. \nIn addition, you can visit the North of Spain since it is very beautiful with marvelous landscapes and beaches. In the North of Spain the weather is colder than the rest of the country, for this reason, the water of the beaches is very cold and it is very difficult to swim there. However, you must go and know these unforgettable places.\n\nYou say in the letter that you want to work for three months. I think that you can try look for a waiter job in the towns with beaches during the Summer months. It is easier to find a job in the beach than finding it in the centre of Spain. \n\nI´m looking forward to seeing you.\n\nBest wishes.\nBea",

It was about what problems are we going to have in a few years if we don't change anything related to contaminating our environment. \n\nJohn talked about the serious problems there are caused by not recycling things as plastic bags, bottles… that end up floating in the sea because humans don’t take care of our environment, and all this is causing that loads of acuatic animals expire.

  "text": "Dear Madam/Sir,\n\nMy name is Marco Bruno. \nThis is to apply for the position advertised concerning the USA SUMMER CAMPS.\n\nI am Italian, 30 years old. Due to my background I believe to be the ideal person for the abovementioned job.\n\nI have been working with children since I was aged 16. I have been involved in summer camps with children from different background and diverse needs. In particular, I have been dealing for 10 years with children with disabilities. Such experience has been an eye-opener for me. I had the chance to be introduced to a different world and I started looking at the daily life with differnet eyes.\nChildren can indeed teach you a lot, being able to express their feelings with the spontaneity that adults often lack.\n\nA few years ago, I had also the chance to work for 1 year in a school for disabled children and youth in a rural area of Ghana. It was impressive to see the strength showed by those children. Being raised in an environment where personal autonomy is the core, children with disabilities were growing very independent and strong, despite all the challenges they could face on the way.\n\nDuring the year in Ghana, I was part of a team of volunteers working with children. After consulting some children's representatives, we organized Olympic games for the children attending the schools of the area.\nYou do not need much to make children happy and let them enjoy the positive energy given by sane sports competition.\n\nAs volunteers we were also helping the cooks of the schools in the kitchen and in the dining room. Moreover, I had the chance to share with them the recipe of Italian pizza. Since they were already baking bread, they quickly learned how to make a delicious pizza as well.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe to meet the requirements of the job and I kindly ask you to consider me for it. My experience with children from different ages and Countries makes me a suitable person for the position advertised by your Esteemed Company.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMarco Bruno\n",

  "text": "TENNIS AND NOTHING ElSE\nWHY TENNIS\nThere seems to be nothing better, nothing more interesting, exhiliring, breathtaking or stunning just as taking up this sport. It can't be compared to anything else if it comes to all emotions and feelings which are connected with playing tennis. Being on the court,it appears to be funny, gives me a feeling of fulfilment.\nPREPARING FOR THE GAME\nNot everybody knows how much devotion and determination requires being a good player. You just surely have to work your fingers to the bones but it's definitely worth. It's also not said but tennis is one of sports which causes an enermous amount of injuries, so that's necessary to be under constant control of your doctor! Despite all obstacles, I wouldn't change this entertainment on anything else. The amount of pleasure which I can get it's simply incomparable to anything else. \nADVICE AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nIf I were to start my new sport career, I would choose a good medical care at fist. Maybe it's not a vital part of being a well known sportsman but it's important when you want to work something off during your career. The second thing, it's a quality of an equipment. There are a lot of bergains and cheap items on the market, which very often catches our eye but I want definitely warn you against it! Don't be mean and spent as much money as it's needed. I hope that you won't hesitate any more and that you start playing tennis at the moment!\n",

  "text": "Dear Mr. Hooper,\n\nIntroduction\nthe aim of this report is the desciption of the shopping facilities in my home town – Vienna. Vienna is the capital of Austria and located in its east.\n\nFindings\nVienna contains a lot of great shopping areas, that is why I am going to speacialse on the three most popular places.\n\nConclusions\nI would like to start of with one of the most renownedly malls - called „Donauzentrum“. It is situated in Kagran and can be easily reached by subway. It covers about 60 shops. The mall is linked to an entertainment section, called „Donauplex“. The Entertainment section stays open after the mall closed. There you can find a cinema, some restaurants and bars.\nOn the countryside you can find the recently edified mall named \"G3\". I would recommend you to go there by car. It contains nearly the same shops as the „Donauzentrum“ and several restaurants and cafés. \nThe „Mariahilferstraße“ is the perfekt place for people that want to avoid overcrowded malls. This street is one oft the most popular shopping streets of Vienna. Even the most extravagant shops can be found there. It is not only worthy to attend the street by day but also by night. Beside the shops some nice bars and restaurants can be found. \n\nRecommendations\nTo not to lose the track I am going to give review. Espacially on a rainy afternoon the \"Donauzentrum\" and \"G3\" are the prefekt way to spend your day. To people who prefer spending their time on the countryside I would commend a visit on the „Maria Hilfer Straße“.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n\nJames Mehler\n",

  "text": "Many people feel that learning English especially in 'England' or in 'The USA', is better than learning that in a country that does not have English as its mother tongue. For instance, in Peru everybody speaks Spanish so you are not accustomed to the language.\n\nThe advantages of learning English abroad are the everyday practice, which you should have if you are in an English country and all the people who you get to know from all the world. One argument in favour of this idea is that Peruvian people who learn English for a short period and then travel abroad, have an enhancement in just one or two months.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages are that you do not know how to behave in another culture. And it is difficult to change your everyday routine. Also, you can suffer from jet-lagged if you travel a long distance.\n\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that people ought to study abroad if they have the opportunity, so apart from your lessons you can interact with native people and learn usually-common phrases.",

  "text": "People travel less in public vehicles these days.Many thinks that life of public transport is going to end.I believe that it is true because the people are more concerned about their privacy and time taken to travel by the public transport.In this essay these worries are studied carefully.\n\nPrivate vehicle offers more privacy than public vehicle.A breast feeding woman can feed her baby in the car without worrying about her privacy.For example,If she is sitting on a bus, she couldn't feed her child because people sit in the nearby seats they may gaze at her.On a hot day the lady can't remove her coat to reduce body heat.For example,A lady travel on a bus and if she removes her coat everybody will look at her and probably tease her but in her car she can do what ever she want.Hence,the private vehicles give enough privacy and comfort for a family.\n\nThe public transport may take more time to travel and have rigid schedule than private vehicles.A car can be drove very fast in order to reduce the time taken to travel.In case a person who is going for an interview for a job,punctuality is a must ,hence he can drive his car fast or can go earlier in his car to reach there early.But he could not travel on a bus very fast in order to reach destination very quickly.Because public transport have a fixed timetable.Hence public vehicles take more time to travel.\n\nIn conclusion,usage of public transportation is reducing day by day.People are getting anxious about their privacy and the trip time.In order to boost the usage of public transport the government or the governing body should consider these factors and must find a solution to these problems.

  "text": "We almost forget about those days before the Internet arrived. The technology has changed us much faster and more dramatic than we used to think. We had to carry a map for our adventure 10 years ago. Nowadays all of what we need is a full charged smart phone with the Google Map application. In the past people could only have a purchase from store to store by themselves, now we can browse almost hundreds of goods on line and buy it through a simple  click. For this tremendous outcome I believe that our lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years, with greater extension to every aspect of our lives.\n\nIn my imagination, the future would be more messy and crowded with less species of creature but more of us, the human beings. We will face the more serious problems of global warming and other awful environmental pollution. Some of the countries will be submerged entirely into the sea, some will survive, and less space for increasing people. Fortunately the most outstanding scientists will solve the energy crisis and will find ways to create new lands for living, to clean air for breathing, and to purify water and food for supply.\n\nOther than the situation I mentioned above, we will have our memories and knowledge being replicate in the form of digital data. We can access all the knowledge from the Internet as we need. When we have a dementia (a steady degeneration disease of our brains ) we can take back our lost memories from the backup system of on-line \"Big Cloud\" memories. No longer do we suffer from studying foreign languages as our eyes are capable of translating to the language we known though the linkage to the huge database online. Also, we can change our emotions by releasing some invisible chemicals which can trigger off reactions in our brains. We can experience the most extraordinary dreams without harmful effects to our personalities. Moreover, our clothing will be able to change colours and patterns even the physical functions corresponding to  the changing environments or simply by our specific commands. However, the more we feel convenient, the more damages to our intellect. We don't have to think too much about almost everything, needing no person to company with since we have all these distractive devices for joy and relaxation. The distance between people will increase dramatically until we finally wake up from all of these unrealistic convenience we have. \n\nIt sounds like a scary science fiction, but it may happen if we keep pursuing only values of materials. What thing the most important is to set a right direction for the future of us. We have a lot of problems waiting to be solved. For example, saving the endanger wildlife and the scarce fish in the sea is much more important than those inventions which only make our lives more convenient. Time-saving and convenience are admittedly considered two essential values of modern lives. Nonetheless, we have to confront the truth that the resources from all over the world are distributed unfairly. The top 50 riches in the world hold most of the power to control the direction of our future. ",

We may think that depends on how you like to travel, as they all have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhen you travel by land, train is one of the best options. however you can't travel by train when you want to cross the sea. But personally, my favorite way to travel is by plane. It is faster than the two, it is no difficult to travel on it and it is quite comfortable.

If I have the opportunity to help you in your organization, please no doubt that I will certainly do so. \nFirstly I strongly recommend you to visit the main capital, which is full of marvellous historical and cultural sites such as museums, art galleries, monuments and churches. Whether at some point you are fed up with art and culture, the city offers to you a lot of leisure time facilities such as concerts, exhibitions, festivals and so on! From the main capital you can easily travel by train or plane and reach in a few hours all the major cities both in the North and in the South of the country. \nAs you arrive during the summer, you should then have a vacation in the South where the beaches are breathtaking, with such a clean water and golden long shores. In connection with your desire to find a job, you should try to find a temporary job in the tourism field: as you wrote, you're searching for a monthly job and I reckon that a seasonal job for the summer would perfectly fit your expectations. By the way, a friend of mine runs an hotel in a seaside resort and I know that he was looking forward to an English native speaker who could help him with his foreign guests. If you are interested, I could give you his phone number and e-mail so that you two are able to speak about the matter and maybe find an agreement. \n",

  "text": "At first you should visit sights like a churches and  a cathedrals then move to the town centre and go through the town park. There you will find beautiful countryside and gorgeous swans, which stay there for the whole year.\nI can recommend you to visit the library. It´s quite architecturally significant building I think, plus there is about million books, so you can learn something new about our culture. \nThere are also good pubs and restaurants. There is a pub called Richard´s. You can easily find it because it´s huge green building just next to the library. There you can taste our national cuisine bud also their international cuisine is tasty. Just do not order the pancakes, because they do really bad pancaces. If I were you I would ordered the shots of alcohol because there is a toy train which will deliver the shots to you.\n You can also go to the club. There are some clubs in the town: the A´s and the Subway, which are in the centre, and the Barrel, which is on the outskirts of the town. I go to the A´s quite often, about once per month, but I have never been in the Barrel so I can´t tell you, what it is like. So if you will go to the A´s you will find it by the lights. In front of the building are enormous reflectors which shines into the darkness. \nNot far from the town lies zoo. You definitely have to visit it. There are about thousand of animals and in the midlle of it is located  a gorgeous castle. ",

  "text": "Charles Dickens and Emily Bronte are both Victorian writers. Their novels have much in common: first of all the plot is usually pretty complex (as we can see in David Copperfield by Dickens and Wuthering Heighs by E. Bronte), and so are the characters, which are always well described especially on a psychological level; furthermore both the authors included in their works the figure of the noble who helps the hopeless child who comes from a lower class. \nThere is also a lot in contrast, most evident is the difference between the settings: Dickens prefers industrial cities while Emily prefers rural villages, and these choices reflect different topics, in fact Charles mostly deals with themes like exploited childhood, the miserable conditions of lower classes and the bad consequences of the industrialisation, instead Emily Bronte is more concerned about the theme of respectability, even if her female heroins do not reflect Victorian values such as chastity and prude. Then we can notice that the narrator of the novel has different roles : Dickens's narrator is omniscient, Emily's one  is part of the story itself and can change revealing  characters’ perspectives. \n",

  "text": "We feel happier during the conversation when someone who has a good sense of humor. Some people agree with that a good sense of humor is not one of the most important human qualities. However, others disagree with it. This is because people who have a good sense of humor can bring joy for others. Also, people could have a good relationship when they have a good sense of humor. Moreover, people can use their humor to overcome some difficult issues. I would like to provide examples to illustrate my thesis. First, people who have a good sense of humor can make others to laugh. Moreover, we can feel happy easily. For example, my friend, Jane, talks lots of jokes to let us laugh out loud. We like to talk to her because she always can bring happiness to us. Also, we can forget lots of annoying things from our work. Consequently, we feel happy so easily because my friend has a good sense of humor. Second, people can make a friend easier when they have a good sense of humor. For instance, my mother always has lots of new ideas, and she likes to tell people in a funny way. Also, after people talked to her, they always wanted to talk to my mother again and are eager to be her friends. In this case, people who have humor can make a friend easily. Third, sometimes a person who has humor can help others to overcome some difficult issues. To illustrate, my niece did not get a great score in his test. His mother told him that he did a great job because he studied so hard. Also, his mother told him he would do better next time. My niece had courage after his mother talked to him. Later on, he got a great score in his test.  To sum up, people who have a good sense of humor can bring happiness to people. Also, people can have a good relationship with their humor. Furthermore, sometime people with a sense of humor can help others to conquer the difficult issues.",

I contain all the characteristics in which you require and so is an ideal person for the job.\n\nFirstly, you should choose me due to the fact that I can talk English very fluently. I've taught at many schools including primary so I got a good encounter of children. As I've also ran the marathon THRICE and play in the local netball team I am quite energetic plus I'm also hardworking as I try my best to reach my ambition. I'm very cheerful to and I rarely lose my temper. I become especially happy when I'm with children!\n\nAlso I'm a good cook; at one school I'd taught at we made cheese and pepperoni pizzas! As a result I am also organised. I am always punctual. I'll be good at preparing all the events as I am- as I already told you- organised.\n\nFinally, to conclude my letter I just want to say: Please choose me! I will make summer camp a much better place to be in!\n\nKind Regards\nJeyatharini Deshpande",

  "text": "Dear Jo,\n\nI am so glad that you would like to come to my country. My \ncountry, Indonesia, is full of natural attraction. It is an archipelago, surely many spots of tourism here. Beach, island, culture, and culinary are the common interest to explore here. If you would like to see wonderful beach, you could come to Bali, Lombok, Sulawesi or Irian Jaya island. If I can say, beaches in those islands are more beautiful and natural than in Java island. \n\nYou could travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali or by  train from Jakarta to Surabaya, so you can take a plane from Surabaya to Bali. If you choose to travel by plane from Jakarta to Bali, the trip will be much shorter, spending only two hours. If you plan to enjoy your trip along fresh greeny landscape in Java island, you can travel by train. It needs almost 15 hours, but you could have the view of villages during the trip. Basically, I like to travel by train for enjoying the view along the railway track. Also, you can interact longer with other passengers especially native Indonesian, just in case you need to explore more about Indonesia as you would like to get temporary job here. \n\nIndonesian people are famous with their friendliness, so you could start a conversation with them to ask anything about Indonesia; they will answer your questions with pleasure. Here are few tips for starting conversation with Indonesian : Indonesian person will reply  a smile with a smile,  so you can start with it; not all Indonesian speaks English, but most  students could speak English. I suggest you to choose college students, because they are more familiar with English, besides they will welcome you with pleasure to experience their English ability; when you are going to use public transportation, you could ask an information you need to the official employee in the station or to student for the same reason, not many Indonesian speak English. \n\nBali is the most famous Indonesian island for foreign people, many of them even know Bali but not Indonesia. Lombok, Sumbawa, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya islands have very beautiful beaches as well. The tourism service in Bali and Lombok is better than other islands mentioned above but other islands are more challenging and natural.\n\nIf you like hiking, you could explore mountains in Java : Semeru, Ranu Kumbolo, Bromo, etc. Joining community of hiking student can be useful, because they will be pleasant free guide for you, this trick has more effective budget for your trip. Another way, you could follow agency to get a guide, but it is not free, you have to manage cost for the service.\n\nIt can be little bit difficult to find temporal job here, unless you got any connections with agency or local people. Teaching English is common job for foreign people, moreover foreigner teacher is more likely than local teacher. May my advice can be useful for your trip in Indonesia. ",

  "text": "It is true that the scale of current marriages is larger and more luxurious than that in the past. There are some reasons for this situation. Personally, I think this development has both positive and negative sides.\nThanks to increasing living standard, people are able to afford a bigger and expensive wedding. If in the past, they just hold weddings at home to save money, now they tend to choose restaurants and hotels instead. Secondly, it is likely that nowadays people focus more on appearance, so luxurious and elegant wedding is an occasion for them to show off. It let people to know that they are important or powerful. Finally, people have more relationships in life as well as in business. Therefore, the number guests invited to the wedding are much more than that those in previous time. A bigger wedding is required to meet this change.\nObviously, expensive and larger marriage have some benefits. It is a special case to bring people together. As a result, more new relationships are created, people get more chance to co-ordinate in business and help each other in life. Those who losing contact for a long time can exchange current information and keep in touch again. Furthermore, modern weddings bring to people new experiences about food, lifestyle and culture exchanging.However, there are also some drawbacks it bring about. These such big and expensive marriages waste a lot of money and time to prepare. Grooms, brides and their parents usually have to book restaurant, hotel, invite singer and famous master of ceremony to make the wedding serious. Instead of that, this amount of money can help the couple buy house or car for a new life. Last but not least, in some cases, only for the sake of showing off, many couples, after getting married, have to work hard to earn money to pay the debt for wedding expenditure.\nTo conclude, marriage is a landmark of individual. However, a wedding with a reasonable scale will either satisfy the guests or reduce the burden for the couple and their families.",

Another thing is that: I would improve my skills in working with children and I find the money useful to expand my academic qualifications. \n    Firstly, I am a young college student, a friendly person and devoted to my studies. I enjoy cooking as one of my hobbies. I also take pleasure in playing tennis, for the benefits of practising sports and staying active. Besides, I particularly enjoy outdoor activities rather than indoor ones. \n   I believe this job would suit me for the following reasons: I am familiarized with the environment in summer camps as I spent my previous summer in one. Another reason is that I have gained experience taking care of children from working as a babysitter recently. Furthermore, I have a great sense of leadership as well as the social skills needed from being a scout for five years. \n    All in all I can assure you that I would be a great addition to your team of workers for all the reasons above stated. For that, I hope my letter is taken into consideration.\nI patiently await an answer.\n\nWith kind regards, Catarina\n",

I came to school with almost zero knowledge of English, and after entry tests, I was applied to level higher than mine. \nWhen I went to class there was a group of students who had already studied together for some time. Being happy together, they were not paying attention to a new girl. There was not a chance to befriend with them, I thought.\nThird school day gone, one of the classmates caught me in a hall and asked if I want to join them tonight for dinner. I was needed practice in speaking so much, so it was what the doctor ordered! There was the only problem: I cannot communicate well in English and I was really shy about it. But when the dinner started there was nothing to worry, because my classmates appeared supportive and patient. This evening was so delightful! I told them about my country and family, I was speaking English and they were understanding me! It gave me a strong belief in future progress in learning. The guy who invited me, Francois from France, spoke with me more than others. Starting to spend every evening together, we spoke about past, expressed our thoughts and future plans. Every time when I felt weak about my English he supported me like no one else. He helped me forget about my fear, because his believing in my success made me stronger. \nAfter two weeks he returned to France, but we keep in touch even today. I am going to France this December, and Francois will show me independent Paris!",

That could be a higher problem if the trend is maintained for a long time because public spending could raise 60 % in the next 10 years.\n\nThe reasons for that may lay in the current financial crisis that is strongly affecting over most middle classes in the country. The low quality  in products that young people eat and the little variety in eating habits could get things even worse. Besides, too much use of computer and mobile phones is not helping to mend the problem at all. Finally, it is proved that youths are devoting less time to do exercise than they should and as a consequence, they are not  improving their general health enough.\n\nAs far as I am concerned, I think Spanish government should implement health programmes and advertisement campaigns in order to improve health in young population. Furthermore, Spanish schools should pay more attention to this matter and teach children how to develop a healthy lifestyle.\n",
