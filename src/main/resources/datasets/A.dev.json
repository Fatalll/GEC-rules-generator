I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car. Also, you'll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number.\n\nIn my experience when I didn't have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house.In my opinion, the car isn't necessary when you have crashed in the street, in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport.\n",

  "text": "In India we have various types of Public transport, like Cycle, Bike, Car, Train & Flight.\nDepending on the distance and duration to the desired place, mode of transport is chosen accordingly.\nBut Generally speaking, travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport.\nThis reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is Agra. It takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to Agra. We have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry, we have purchased some snacks just before the trip. Since, we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car (which is impossible when travelling by train & Flight). In addition to it, we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh. \n\nDue to the above mentioned reasons, I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient.

More importantly, the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world. In this case, the families played important roles in daily lives. The reasons are as follows. First of all, we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience. For example, we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way, and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents. Secondly, the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble. If difficulties was told to the families, the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation.

Usually i play football with my classmates. Before training i ran 1-2 kilometres and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy. Our team has a hard-working coach and he gives professional  advice to us, how to improve football skills. His main words:\"You must work and work very hard,if you want to get high results\". I can say,that coach is experienced person. Not so long ago, we are had competition. The first place was gotting by us. We have achieved this result, because we are friendly and organised.\nI believe, that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Skhatar or Dynamo. Football is my life.

Although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary.\n\nAlso, I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young. It was a lot of time ago,however, I still keep the rhthym in my body! By the way, I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet-course members. I had to be the teacher for one day and I didn’t forget it because I felt wonderful. All members congratulated me,as well. \n\nOn the other hand, I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young. You must know that I’m a very responsible, kind and funny person. That makes me a good candidate to achieve the job, or the hobby for me! \n\nI hope you keep in mind my candidature because I’m not going to disappoint you.\n\nBest wishes, Julia.\n",

  "text": "Although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular, in the future, the stance of public transport is still very crucial. \n\nNowaday, people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling, manufacturing, this source of energy doesn't always maintain at the constant level, but someday it will be run out. People must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity, wind power, public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy. As a result, governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy, travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car. The range of public services will be expanded to remote areas, it become much more convenient. Commuting, travelling using public services will be the first prior choice.\n\nIn addition, the population is increasing rapidly, in the near future, almost cities in the world will become overcrowded, It will lead to many other problems to be solved, for example, traffic jams, air pollution. In some perespectives, these problems are led by the over-using of personal vehicle. People will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air. So the best way for them to travel is public transpotations. \nEach person should practice saving when using any source of eneny to protect his own live. \nIn conclusion, investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably, public services of travelling have a bright potential and it's stance in the future can't be replaceble\n",

  "text": "Good Morning:\n\nThis is an esay about my favourite sport,it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone, I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer, of course.\nI don´t have friends who like swimming, almost like football or similar teams sports, and always I go alone it isn´t boring for me furthermore, I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I haven´t wait anybody. I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spendt a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hais, I hated that! Luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me, and since that day I go for my own.\nSwim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there aren´t many people in the pool, but sometimes there are children and I don´t like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too.\nI would recommended to people who not know swim to learn,because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim.",

A lot of action, drama and romance. The fans of this series, had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared, that was in 2012. I don't think that this movie is for all the family, because is hard for little kids to understand, in opinion I think is more a teen movie. I think people will like this movie because, its very similar to the story of the book; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book, the theme is very unique and original, also the actors in the first movies were perfect, and I think that in the last movie, they will put double effort. \nHope you guys choose this movie!!

  "text": "my favourite sport is Karate. First of all, I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours. When I´ve had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate, because It´s the kind of sport that it isn´t very hard. Training Karate is a way to forget your problems, to forget your tiring routine. In my opinion, it´s very difficult to fnd this advantage with others sports. Apart from that, Karate it´s not just a sport, is also a discipline, it teach you respect, balance even culture. my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture.\nfor someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class, so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing.",

  "text": "All around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school. They are eager to begin a new life as adults. But when they reach in-between period, confused feelings cross their minds. As a rule after last exams they don't know what university to choose. What they will do in future they see, like in a fogg.\nIn this way, idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable. Firstly it'll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard-work studying period. Ten or eleven years at school make them tired, in spite of pupils don't notice it. But choosing the second education is very important step, which need serious attitude. Secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional sphears. Also they would have an opprtunity being involved in volontier activity. And thirdly they might work for earning own money or travel. This year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and gettin new power for future education.\nOne year is not long period. But benefits after year off will be obvious.\n",

They begin to study English at an early age. They use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day. Even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words. That's a good phenomenon, for English is essential nowadays.\n\n    In addition to, some people think English is superior than Chinese. In me opinion, though English is for great significance, but English is after all a foreign language. it is hard for people to see eye to eye. English do help us read English original works, but Chinese helps us learn a true China. Only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilliance. Learning a country's culture, especial its classic culture, the first thing is learn its language. Because of we are Chinese, why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our owne culture through a foreign language?",

In 1993, Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that's change the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game. I love this game because my favourite sport man belong to this game. His name is Mr. Sachin Ramesh Tendulakar know as little master. Whenever I play this game, I always follow this person. His stance, Style, shots,running between the wicket, everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark.Not only me but also every Indian always follow Sachin for cricket. When he was 18, he played first game for India. He is the first player who  played 200 test in cricket. He has many achievement like first 200 in one day etc. I love the way he was played. \n\nFor a nuance first they have to decide what they con do better, batting or bowling. If the person want to become bowler then concentrate on running,action,stance and for batsmen need concentration on lag and bat coordination,eye and bat coordination,discover some shots which became key factor in batting. Also watch videos of some best player like Sachin, Rahul, Sir Don breadman, Hayden, Wasim Akaram, Brett Lee etc. As health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health, stamina.",

  "text": "As far as I’m concerned, I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction. More details and reasons will be elaborated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion.\n\nTo begin with, extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment. There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown. In my childhood, I went there to spend my summer every year. However, it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set.\n\nNext to go will be, the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution. There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral. No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented.\n\nLast but not the least, the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence, especially, to our offspring. To take my friend, Taylor, as an example, her homeland were over-developed and become an arid place when she was a child. After she grows up, she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown. In addition, she has no blithe memory in her childhood.\n\nOne problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us. Due to the mineral development, many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before. It seems like a sought-after chance. Nevertheless, they do not give us any promise of the vacancy. In addition, money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation.\n\nIn a nutshell, Based on the reasons and instances above, the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage. Therefore, I do not subscribe to this decision.\n",

Experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise.\n\nHumanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop. So now we have many choices and an infinity of information available at any given time. With this stated, we now have an idea of how artists create.",

The athletic representative pasted the torch and we sang the anthem. After that, the sports day began formally. At 10:45 a.m. , the girl’s grade C 100-metre race started. There was a funny thing when I went to the marshal. The teacher call my name for twice and he told me to stand different place. So I know that there was someone whose name pronounce same as me. Near the race, I was very nervous. When I was running, I heard my housemates cheering  and the wind passing my face. That feel was very comfortable and made me felt relax. At last, I got number 10 out of 27 people. Although it is not a great result, I’ve already try my best. At last of the day, our school announced the mark the four houses have got. My house which got number two temporarily. I felt hopeful and wanted my house will get the champion.\nOn the second day, my classmates called me to take part the Inter-class relay race.

I implicated my class from winning the champion. At last , my house got the second runner up. I hope my house will get the champion in the next year.\n",

  "text": "The development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere. In case of transportation technology, in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud, train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time. \nAlthough compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option. However, if I have given option to choose between all of three, I will say plane. There are three reason to choose this. First reason is its speed, compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster. It can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours. As a result people can save their time. Second is safety, compared to other the chances of accident is less. That makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat. Third one is comfort level. Plan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat. \nIn conclusion, I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation. The reason behind my choice is speed, safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice.",
