Despite of it is an industrial city, there are many shops and department stores.  I recommend visiting the artificial lake in the certer of the city which is surrounded by a park. Pasteries are very common and most of them offer the special dessert from the city. There are a comercial zone along the widest street of the city where you can find all kind of establishments: banks, bars, chemists, cinemas, pet shops, restaurants, fast food restaurants, groceries, travel agencies, supermarkets and others. Most of the shops have sales and offers at least three months of the year: January, June and August. The quality of the products and services are quite good, because there are a huge competition, however I suggest you taking care about some fakes or cheats.",

We went to play to Acapulco, to an event that unuversities from Mexico go and present like cultural activities. There was too hot. In  Acapulco I had a good time because I stay in the same room that my friends and we swam a lot and we really had fun. Then we went to Taxco. There we visit the central park and we stay in a  very luxury hotel. We were very happy there we really like Taxco. Actually I was already been there before but not with my friends. Then we went to Cacahuamilpa to play there that was an incledible experience that I will never forget. then we return to Toluca to continue with my boring life. And now I have to pass my subjects.

I prefer to spend my free time watching a good film especially when it is a thriller than doing sport, \n\nIf you want to see a good thriller, \"Regression\" will be your best option. I have seen it recently and in my opinion, it should be seen by everyone because I believe people would like it for many reasons. First of all, the director, who was Alejandro Amenábar, did a great job due to that, the spectators were waiting with bated breath as the final of this film will be. Secondly, the actors were fantastic and the main character, which was performed by Emma Watson (who is really hilarious), was amazing. What's more, the plot is easy in order to understand. The history took place in the USA a few years ago when the regression method was accepted by the doctors and cientifics. Moreover, customs, make-up and special effects became ever more in reality the story. However, the soundtrack was awful, it didn't get having a scared.\n\nIn conclusion, my recommendation for the student film club is this fabulous and exciting thiller must be seen if you had spent a good time given than it achieves keeping in suspense until the end and it doesn't be afraid. In addition, you won't have better opportunity to see it than this week, because just moment in Spain the festival's cinema is happening. You should take advantage of that!\n\n\n",

Michael used to have a great time with his cousins, except with Tom. That was because Tom liked to give orders to everyone, and Michel didn't liked that.\nWhen the big family get out of the plane, they realize that they were wearing too much clothes, it was boiling!!\nThere they took a taxi to the hotel, and at 4 pm. the family was walking around the luxurious hotel.SOme minutes later they designate how the cousins were going to share the rooms.\nMichael finally ended with the last one he would like to; Tom.

Some historians claim there were 20 over inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Edison’s version but Edison is often credited with the invention because his version was able to outstrip the earlier versions because of a combination of three factors: \"an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.\" (taken from www.bulbs.com)\nEdison began a serious research about the incandescent light bulb on October of 1878, and his original design were in 1879.

In the day, he was a mild monster, he was very visible (because he was big); but in the night, it was the contrary, he kill people, destroys complete cities; he smash all the architecture from the city, and a lot of bad things.  \nOne day, Monsteration's next destination was the city of Michenstain. All the people didn’t know what that was, so they didn’t care about it. But when he arrived to Michenstain, all the people went: “DAHMMMMMMMMMM”. It was in the midnight when arrived, so he was eager to destroy everything. So all the people started to run and scream, and the monster was pursuing all of them. He was spoiling all the crops from the people, he was destroying all the vehicles, and he destroyed a vast area. \nThe next day, he was a very attractive monster, in other words, he was convert in other monster body. He was completely different; it was impressive the way he was acting. The thing that he (the monster) didn’t know about was that he had a spectacular infection (literally spectacular) that I thing that it have no cure, it was called “The Monsteration Infectations”. (On those times there were diverse monster, but none of them was like him; he was in the number 1 rank of the monster in destroying things.)\nThe scientists are trying to make a cure for the Monsteration Infectations, but they still don’t have it. In their laboratory, they have a lot of chemicals that were prohibited in their country, but they used them. They had to isolate the chemicals to the formula to have the cure. Some scientists didn’t care about the infection; they were playing ultimate team in their iPods. The scientists that were doing the formula had a lot of tension, but finally, they did it and they said: “Magnificent”.\n\n",

  "text": "On Thursday, September 11, the term exams finished and our week of vacation started. In the afternoon I went to my dance classes. it was fun because we learn a new hip hop dance and we finished our tap dance.\n\nOn Friday I went to the mall with my family. I bought one sweater and two jeans. Later I went to the book store and bought three books; “legend”, “wonder”, and “Eleanor & Park”.\n\nOn the weekend I stay at home. I start reading “Eleanor & Park”; it was amazing, I was laughing a lot because the things that the characters said. The other things I do were sleeping, ate, and watch TV. \n\nThe next day I went with my friends to see a movie. We saw “if I stay” and I loved it. The movie is about a teenager named Mia that had a car accident with her family. Her father and her mother died before they arrive to the hospital. Mia survive but she is in a coma and she have to decide if she wants to live without her mother and father or if she wants to die.\n\nLater in the week I pass the day drawing. I draw a meadow, a little girl, and a butterfly. The next days I didn’t do much. I just sleep and watch movies at home. The day before I start school, I do an investigation for literature class.\n\nThis was what I did in my vacations, I didn’t do a lot but I loved my vacations. \n",

I like to play football and floorball, I like also to be with my friends and it’s also fun to play video-games.I am good at floorball and not as good at football. Sometimes I play golf and I think it’s pretty fun, I like to be out with our sail boat.\n\n I got 1 sister, her name is Tina, she is annoying. She’s 9 or 10 years old I don’t really know. I like to be in Thailand because it’s nice and warm and the people there are very nice, I also like the food. I dont like homework but I dont forget it, I am good to tease my little sister and I am proud of it. I also got an cat her name is chelsea .My favorite food is fillet of beef, scallops and maybe sushi. I see forward to friday when I am going to cinema with my friends, we’re going to see “Let’s be cops”. My favorite is Narnia. I don’t like Narnia, but my favorite movie is probably 22 jump street, Lord of the rings, The tv-show: suits, The walking dead and maybe south park and family guy. I am good at floorball and not as good at football. Sometimes I play golf and I think it’s pretty fun, I like to be out with our sail boat. \n\nI don’t like to read but I like music, good music. I like alot of artist and a lot of different music genres. I like all from pop, electronic, hip hop to calm music. I am watching a few tv-series but I watch them over the internet so I am not trying to time the clock to see a episode. I like the restaurant we ate on when we were on a ski-vacation in Champoluc. \n\n",

I applied in one music club in our city and I was really excited when they repplied and asked me to help because I enjoy going to rock concerts and I was truly curious about how the backstage is working. What was mny job? Mostly I helped others an carried the stuff. I enjoyed working with a soundmaster so far. It was quite stressful but at the end of the concert the atmosphere was amazing. People were singing and shouting - they all seem to be really happy. I hope I will do that again once.\nSee you arrond\nSteve",

If you want to relax you can also go to mountains or sea. Even there you can meet really nice people and talk with them. But let's talk about work there.\nWe appreciate kind and hard working people. But you can't expect that they are going to pay you a lot of money.Rate is pretty low. But there is a chance that you can meet generous people.\n\nTake care\nOla",

  "text": "In this essay I would like to highlight how a wide range  of public transport  can help people to save a bit of money and a lot of stressful hours stuck in the traffic jam. \n\nFirstly as everybody know the cost of the fuel is increasing more and more,  adding to those the bill that own a car will bring, it became immediately clear that it is cheaper go around by public transport. Why then there still be so many people who prefer to drive their own car instead of seat comfortably on the train or on the tube reading their favorite book on their way to work ? I would say that this is because the public transport are not so efficient as the should do. \n\nIn my town for example, I have been Waiting for up to forty minutes before I could take a bus. I strongly believe that it is a shame because a lot of people like me would live their vehicles at home and take a train instead.\n\nSecondly , the environment would improve its state indeed, as far as I can see the pollution caused by the traffic is ruining monuments and making the air dirty and heavy, the same is as far as waste of time is concerned, obviously the fewer cars are around the quicker you can get where you want.\n\nIn conclusion I would really like that politicians who care about public transport will improve the services so that more people could leave their vehicles at home and move around much more easily.",

Well, ecologists say that get around using transport public is more beneficial for the environment than using the car or motorbike. In recent years the numbers of people who use public transport has increased a lot, in comparison with ten years ago. But actually does it has a future?\nIt's more comfortable, faster and preferable than have to run to take the bus, wait the train, etc. This is a fact which indicates the public transport there is no future in our society. Other signals are, for example, if you travel by car, you can park the car in front of the place where you want to go. But if you take the bus, you have to take down in a bus stop, maybe a bit far from where you want to go. Also it has to say that maybe in the future, technology will create a car that doesn’t pollute the air, and then, use public transport won't be necessary.",

The Indonesia Government itself doesn't seem to give a damn about their country's cleanliness, and the citizen too. it caused our river some big problems such as disease, unpleasant smell, flood, etc. i myself, by seeing the river filled with garbage, always seems to be disgusted by the stench and the unpleasant look from the garbage. And in Tangerang, the air is polluted by Carbon dioxide and the other materials. And also, after the river, the road in the city is also contaminated by the garbage. garbage everywhere. the condition of my country is really critical, I guess. And the amount of the city's garden doesn't match the amount of the population and pollution in that city. There are a lot of high-rise building and it provokes flood along the high-rise building's section. I wonder if the citizen in my country and town could make a better environment area by throwing garbage on its place and try using an eco-friendly transportation. And the government, pls don't be so flabby with your own citizen. yes, be strict. I think it's okay because the purpose of you doing that is to train the citizen to be more responsible for what they did. and , I think it's enough from me. I suppose, the government also have studied this situation too. But they didn't do that much after knowing this truth. I hope Indonesian government take an action about this situation because if it continues then Indonesia would be the most unclean country over the other countries. ",

Let's look at the most popular places where tourists prefer spending their free time in Moscow. \nI'm sure i'll agree that the Red Square is the most popular sight in captial of Russia. That's why I suggest starting the journey from this place. You can get there by metro (Teatralnaya Station). From the Red Square you can easily see Moscow Kremlin, St. Basils Cathedral, the State Historical Museum and Gum Trading House. If you are dying of hunger you can have a quick snack at Teremok cafe or have a square meal at the restaurant №57, which on the the third floor of the Gum. \nI prefer spending my free time in the parks. Gorky Park is my favorite place for my leisure. It's a capital's central park where you'll wind lots of interesting affairs. There are lots of facilities such as sports centre, ping pong club, hire centre etc. There is an open-air cinema, but it opens only after 10.00 PM. \nSo, if you want to have a memorable holiday, the capital of Russia is the most attractive place.

In my opinion the main course needs a lack of improvement.\nFirstly,I am a vegetarian and I don't have much choice of vegetables. Secondly there are not much variety of dessert mainly fruits and puddings. There is not much variety of healthy drinks,there not much hot drinks as well.\n\nSome people say that in my college are vegetarian,Muslim,vegan e.c.t and they do not have much variety of food to choose like halal meat and veg and nothing that comes from animals.\n\nIt is considered that you change the type of food regularly. Reduce the fast food that make people obese and not healthy.It will be better if you gave drinks compared to the weather like whenever its winter we would like a hot drink and if it is summer we would like a chilled drink.\n\nI hope you consider this major problem in the cafe.Thank you.\n\n\nYours faithfully ",

I believe both are useful.\n\n      Firstly, there is plenty of people who cant buy a car and so the only option they have is to travel by these transports. The ticket doesnt cost to mutch and it is avaible for the majority of the people at least comparing to buying a car.\n\n      Secondly, public transports are more eficent to travel for long distance than cars and people wouldnt have to purchase combustible. When people are avaible to tavel to other continents or far away, they may need a plane, wicth is a public transport, to complete the journey because the have tu cross oceans and clomplicated distances that have different landforms.\n\n      However, a car is something witch is from the person and he can do wathever he wants and find it in the same way he or she left it, and sometimes public sports arent left in the best way. In addiion, you have to share with people you absolutely dont know and probably wont see again. Consequesntly yo can be stole or get sick. But, by obseving all these people you can rich yourself with different cultures and manners the other have and incorporate new topics.\n\n       To conclude we can establish a middle point. Public sports are useful but sometimes inconvenient but more cheaper. You can get to know new people and different cultures.",

But most of young society are not interested this type of music. for instance they prefer Pop or also rock music. Through you listen the music you can expressed your emotions and this is the most beautiful thing. Secondly, they like  watching series in a TV. That make their happy and additionally make loud. Usually the watch criminal series because it's very interesting and really mysterious. Teenagers have different styles. A lot of young mans love wearing jeans and t-shirt. Because it's very comfortable. But girls love wearing skirt and snug shirt. I think the style is very important in our life. Across style we can express our emotions and feelings. In conclusion life of young people is not very easy. We have a lot of unhappy days and we have a lot of problems too. ",

In another way of saying, this kind of education system should be included in the whole classes in all schools. However, I strongly believe that the measurement of education level does not explicitly interest with sex differences in the classes, but also it is related to the quality of education level in the schools.\n          Education has a crucial part in one society and it’s future and by improving the level of educations system, students can learn more effectively in their entire education life and their career but also their skills will be improved by this process. Nowadays, unfortunately, students cannot take enough education from their schools whereas in some poor countries. Their systems are no longer that good enough and students will not make a good career for their future.\n         On the other hand, by building more effective learning system which will provided by local authority, students will encouraged them learn more efficient. Lack of teaching way, poor audience of the class, quantity of learning materials, for instance, all of these matters should be enhanced until the good quality has been set up in the system. Besides, by putting these kinds of procedures, students will  also gain more respect towards career and their job. Hopefully, they will reach not only earn more money in their entire life but also society will have more development shape in any other developed counties.\n           It is true that coeducation can motive the student while they work with other sex group students, we ought to also bear in mind, this is not only solution to get best result. Therefore, we should consider other kinds of problems which affect on education system. \n       In a nutshell, based on the above-mentioned point such as, quality of educations system not only interests with mix-education but also it will need some good solutions in some subjects that mentioned. It is personally concluded that this kinds of developments will be put into the action for all schools shortly.\n         \n",

Consequently, people prefer move in your own car.\n\nOn the other hand, I think there are two aspects that can change the actual situation. The first is, The government can create a new plan os construction of trains. The second aspect is, people can help to pay more tax to buy new buses.

  "text": "There are widely differing views on the issue of whether or not the benefits of study foreign language in earlier age outweigh the drawbacks. Some people would suggest that learning new language before second school discourage their usual learning and that would struggle their understanding of other subjects. However, I personally believe that the advantages is overweight. The reasons for this as follows.\nLearn how to walk before learn how to run, the opponents contend the children confuse the words and phrases with their mother tongue. Confronting with challenges, primary students are struggled on the difference between first language and the learning one. Thus, people view that children learn foreign language at primary school are worse than later.\nNonetheless, I would contend that learning foreign at primary school brings countless benefits to children. Primary school, the best moment for learning, children are easier and faster to gain knowledge. Not only less study burden when compare by secondary school, but they are able communicating with foreigners as well as extend their societal network during that period and the later life. Rather than concern about the challenges, children would confront with, it is particularly advantaged for them to grasp foreign language during the elementary school.\nBy way of conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that advantages of learning foreign language at primary school is much outweigh than the drawbacks. Given that these children would have a better development in the future as well as more free time.",

Not only the supermartket has these containers, they are also in the schools of the neighbourhood. In my opinion this gives a good example of the involness of the local government.\nAnother point where I'm pleased about is that our town is kept clean by a special group of employees of our community. This happens weekly. They walk around in all the streets and pick up all the dumped material.

First of all, the biggest problem is studying. It is not easy to adapt a new learning environment, the language is the biggest difficulty. Students have to do assignments with another language and use different thinking manner. The second problem could be from peers’ stresses. The culture shock is that international students need to overcome. Students want to make new local friends, but cultural customs and taboos could be a problem to be noticed and adapt. Lastly, the problem is from students themselves. Leaving comfort zone, and everything is fresh. Students have to confront and get over every challenge. As family and friends do not accompany, students must do a lot from basic living to future studies. It is hard to live overseas alone, Therefore, making friends from the same country can assist one another. Besides, attempting open mind. To get along with international friends is a great way to expand horizon.",

  "text": "To: Tourist Office\nFrom: ELiza Anna\nSubject: Shopping facilities \n\n\nReport on the shopping facilities in Katowice\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe aim of this report is to describe and assess shops, which could be interesting for tourists. The majority of people visiting Katowice are focused on three matters: sovenirs, fashion and food.\n\nSouvenirs\nIt seems that there is not many places in city center where you can find souvenirs like postcards or books about the history of Katowice. Fortunately,  visitors would find all of that in the Tourist Information Ofiice and in shops on the outskirts. The one, which is really worthy to see is \"Kato-Sovenirs\". They provide all sorts of funny local gadgets.\n\nFashion\n",

Watching football is also a wonderful experience. My favorite international league is the English premiere league. My advice to anyone who will start this sport is to start it early and play it regularly not to loose fitness. Also joining a team will be a great idea.",

  "text": "The environment is an important part of our life contributing  in a positive way in our part of life  without even concern about important parts for us to survive. Humans can easily damage the environment just throw their waste without recycling or ruin the places where animals are living. Deforest the woods can damage the cycle of nature.Without forest can't be animals and the human being  can disappear. Some people don't even care and just the don't to earn money deforests the trees and sell to do furniture. They even are not plant other trees. I notice that in supermarkets are using so much plastic just to cover a small thing or are using many plastic bags without even think how vulnerable is for the environment.\nI used to live for a short time in a place where word recycle was completely ignored but they used to this because that wasn't so rich. Where I live now I noticed that have the opportunity to recycling the waste because it is a posh area. In my opinion I think the government should take care of all area, even is a poor or rich area. The pollution has a negative contribution to the environment .I saw on television that wild birds are healthier in rural area than birds from urban area. Birds from urban area is difficult for them to find a proper food instead. Some people from area which I live they used to feed the birds but others they don't even care. To keep all the nature alive we must contribute everyone of us for future generation. ",

If in a city there were only cars, the city wouldn't afford enough parking lots and roads, all the cars would jam the city, and people wouldn't get their destinations. On the other hand, cars need more gasoline than buses which let out CO2 and other kinds of waste gases into the air, leading to the serious air pollution. So, what we need is to devote much more money and time to improve the public transport. Public transport will have bright future; on the contrary, travelling by car will vanish from our life.",

I had to say that feeling was really awesome. It made me feel like that happiness is running through out my body.\nI will suggest people who want to starting this sport, first you must find five to six friends to make a team, and then look for other friends to make another team, so that you can fight with other to get the score. second, all you have to do is warm your body, if you don't warm it before the race you might hurt yourself.

  "text": "Our Future's Lives:\n\nThe past already happened, we cannot change it. The future we do not know what's coming. But the present we live it, we live the moment and benefit from it at the maximum. If you ask someone about the future, answers will be different but all will be around two main topics, Those last are either optimist future or pessimist one. As far as I am concerned. I do believe that people's lives in the future will change toward the bad. No because I am pessimist but due to several factors and condition allow me to divulgue my opinion.\n\nFirstly, we are living in unstable world. It is true that every day we have new innovation which help people and make their life more easier. But from life's experiences we can learn that the hidden target of human is not to help each other to lessen the burden of life. Human are looking for a power and they are applying forest law, The stongest beat the weakest. To illustrate. There are a categorisation of countries, there are developed countries, emerged one and on the way of development countries. Who classified those countries like this? whare the critria of this ranking? and...\nThese questions and a lot of queries of many people looking for convenient answer. Hence, The above indicates details support the idea that there will be a change in people's lives but in negative side.\n\nIn addition, A general vision on the human innovation show that the majority of people creations have bad effect, this effect exist even in people's lives or themselves. And unfortunately this bad impact exist almost in all lives filed. For example. Chemical drugs can help peolple to heal and improve from diseases but have another hidden effect. This effect always leaves people suffering later after the usage. Therefore, The afformentioned information above show that our future can be worse than our present.\n \nTo summarize, People's life knows a fast change and development, but generally this evolution affecting people. Should live in stabele and peaceful world. We must stop all wars, conflict and impose human beings principls and values.\n",

This may be due to people are not aware about consequences of this bad habit- spreading the rubbish. But, in these days, with education, people are becoming more sensible and responsible towards the environment.\n\nIn the same line, dwellers of my village are doing lots of work to make their area clean and hygiene. They collect house hold waste in a dustbin and put off with proper standard procedure. They collect and segregate the rubbish in separate containers. For example, they collect plastic waste in yellow dustbin while, liquid and solid, degradable waste in red container. This makes easy and convenient to identify the waste types.\n\nTo conclude, I would like to say that nowadays people are becoming more aware and conscious towards environment through education.    ",

  "text": "  At this time and age, most of the people have their own car or vehicle for their transportation. It is also make convenient for people who are rushing time to work, meeting and so on. However, I have no agree with this statement because the public transport is needed for someone who are no have vehicle or economic downturn. Public transport is cheap and friendly for environment.\n firstly, the fare of public transport is cheaper compared with buying a new car. The person that do not have to save large amount of money to buy the car. They can use the money in more useful or meaningful way such as investment property.             \nThe fare of public transport is less than own vehicle when compared fare of bus to fulfill whole tank of oil. Some more they are needed to pay a parking fee for parking.\n Secondly, air pollution is a serious problem nowadays. Because of everybody has to leave for another place through their own car and carbon dioxide released from the car. The public transport is a way to reduce the air pollution because it can carry more than a dozen times the people in a time and reduce their own vehicle. So, it can also help to reduce the traffic jam problem.\n Lastly, public transport that are always blamed by the people that are slowly and trouble than own vehicle. Although the public transport is slow but it also do not take a long time of people to reach their destination because public transport nowadays are developed more fast and enough.\n  In conclusion, public transport is needed for everybody in a necessary time. It always can make us save the money and make the environment more nature and fresh.\n",

It is a veri quiet place, because of its location, in the middle of the forest, only a few people know how to get there. You can only arrive at `A Fervenza´ walking or riding a bike, but it is impossible to get there by other ways. It is an invledible forest place, the ground is full of low grass and there is a little river where you can swim, is is the perfect place to have a quiet day.\n\nThat is all I can tell you about this place.

We start little by little to help it.\n\nFirst of all, I want to emphasize on reducing the usage of plastics. It's the basic things and a habit that we can start easily from our own. Plastics are non-biodegradable which degrade after 1000 years. Non-biodegradable plastics could actually piles up the landfill and cause the land use in our earth to be occupied. Besides, it destroys the marine ecosystem in such a way that the seabird or fish are fed on plastic. This cause their reproduction system to be destroyed.Hence, we should bring our own recycle bag or basket every time we go for shopping and resist temptation to get plastic from them.\n\nBesides, we should use public transport or carpool in order to reduce the CO2 emission into the environment.If the distance to destination is short, we could replace driving by walking or cycling. That's the descent way in reducing the adverse environmental impact and we are able to protect our Earth",

The speed of life has been fastened, people don't have time to wait for a taxi or in the bus stop to get their work done, they want their work done in the blink of an eye. So the need for bus has become unnecessary and our own cars are simply time consuming. Everyone has a car. Even kids started to learn driving at fifteen and most of the parents gift cars in their sixteenth birthday. We can seen determine the future of transportation by differentiating the numbers of cars and buses. Students have started to use their own cars than the bus. So I think the future of public transportation is in darkness. ",

I bought shoes, clothes and GPS watch,I told myself:now it is a challenge, I must defeat myself .The first day is so painful, I was tired to die when I just ran nearly 3km, but things becomes better and better, and now I could run 10km.\n If you want to start running, firstly, you need a comfortable shoes and clothes, and secondly, make a plan, like how long should I run today, remember, appropriate rest is necessary. Don't make a goal that you can't reach,or you will lose your confidence soon. the most important thing is your willpower.",

In order to reduce energy consumption should be made so that as much as possible lectures takes place in the day time. This would reduce energy needed for the light sources.\nSecondly, what sort of things can we recycle in the college? It would be a good idea to recycle paper, glass, metal and plastic. In order to improve the sorting, there should be a litter bins for each mentioned substances in  classrooms, corridors and outside.\nFurthermore,the student and tutors should be encouraged to use public transport, cycling or walking. \nFinally, all the student should be taught lectures about the environment.\nI hope I find the answers to your question in my letter.\nYours sincerely\nZivile Jureviciute",

So will following more jams, if we do not change our habits. The results, which will follow, will be the pollution of the environment. So we need a new system. There should be a ban of cars.

  "text": "In today's class, we were discussing about wheather or not we agree to the common enourmous payed salaries of fooball Players. For me, as a passionated Soccer Player, it is a good Point to consider. I recommand to the Clubs, be warned. \n\nFor instance Christiano Ronaldo. For him, as one of the top sheld payed Players of european leagues, it is no big deal to buy a Mercedes Benz. He is arrogant. He does not Need another one, but he likes the colour. This way of thining he also Shows in game time. He is not chasing after the ball, is not fighting enough to Keep  it In the case he would really Need the Money, he would behave totally different. \n\nWhat influences does this salaries have on the Clubs is quite simple. They sell the tricots for 20 Euros more per Piece than last season. By this aciton a Ronaldo or messie can be payed and it is possible to buy the best Team fo the league, like Bayern Munich is doing at the Moment.\nBut consider the reaction of the fans. For them it is not possible anymore to rule for their Teams at any home game. The tickets are to expensive. The Anger will spoil over someday. This makes Football or Soccer ever more equisite to a certain Group of fans - Hooligans. \nAs a result of These Action, it is an uncertain way to go for the Clubs. If it stays on a certain Lever, no fan will complain about higher Prices. But if the Prices will be to high, no onw would visit the games anymore. The aim is to find a balanced way. \n",

For example, restaurant business and technology industry is totally different in Taiwan. \n  In these 10 years, Taiwanese have become enjoy our life, so many people like to drink coffee or have an afternoon tea. That is why many business men want to win in this competition, so they created so many bargain activities, like if you check into places, you will buy one get one free. Apparently, restaurant business is creative and marketing-orientation in Taiwan. \n  In contrast, there are two different type of company in the technology industry. One is original equipment manufacturer, like Foxconn, workers in the company always need to do the same thing and the executive in Foxconn also always need to bargain with Apple or Samsung. Although they produce high quality products they receive a little money and have high pressure in work. The other one is original brand manufacturer, like htc, they produce a lot of new smartphones and sell it. In three to four years ago, htc makes so much money in the Europe, Taiwan and Japan. The company likes to produce new products and use high salary to hire great talents. So htc became more energetic and bold in making innovation.In Taiwan, many young people want to enter htc.\n  Finally, Taiwan still suffers economic slump, but we have so many businesses likes to innovate, market their product, customers likes to buy it. I think Taiwan will be recovery in the near future.\n",

For example, some people who have lots of money living in shenzhen earn more money by buying low price and selling high price, although they have house to live. Also, it is reported that Chinese investors have driven up housing prices in Vancouver by 12%.\n Therefore, no longer on the acts go unheeded, and the governments have to deal with these problems.

  "text": "\n     My favourite sport\n\n     I have been playing tennis since I was a teenager and for that reason tennis is my favourite sport.\n     The main reason by which I like playing tennis is because I can control the amount of exercise that I can do. Tennis is not a coletive sport. There are necessary just two players and if you get tired and lose a match no one is going to be responsible but yourself. That`s why you can control your limits. Besides, you do not need a lot of people, as on football match for example, to play tennis. Sometimes it is difficult  to join so many fellows to practise a coletive sport. Undercontrary, on a tennis match you need just one, doesn`t matter if man or woman. The exception is in a match of double. Even that you have to find only three more players in this case.\n     But, although all these advantages, the tennis player has to take care with some dangerous situations. For example, never starts a match without a warm up because you can suffer serious muscular injury. It happened with me once and was very unconfortably. Another very commom risk is to fall on the square which can cause dangerous scratches.\n     In despite the risks, I recommend this sport for everyone who has a good physical condition. Buy a good racket, wear a pair of good shoes, find someone to practise and start to enjoy.",

The other is, travelling by car isn't convenient if you go to the famous resorts, most famous resorts lack of parking lots, travelers may spend hours to park. On the contary, people who take the public transport can more enjoy the travel because they don't waste vitality on driving.

It is a bit far from my home, behind  the fuel station once we left your car. To answer your question, I can not attend the party beacuse I do not like theese kind of parties, but I wish you good luck!Almos",

It's comum in city the bus. Some bus have special and preferencial sit to old people. This is interesting because people are practice solidary. I think could have a lot bus in city. Many car is poluent for planet and is alergic to people. The train don't have poluition. This transport is better to population and don't have traffic in city.

You stay in queue for buy a ticket. \nSecondly, you should feel uncomfortable. At some means of transport is too crowded and you haven' t got a place to stay. sometimes you lie on a window. It isn't good.\nFinally, if you ride a car you musnt care about timetable. You can go at every hour. When you go by bus for example, you must wait at cold bus station.

When Jake said that, we start roar with laughter, but then, another friend offered the idea to do a home film. The experience about the film was amazing, because we laugh all night and we enjoyed that very cool idea. In itself, the film didn't have an especially topic, but I can describe it like friend's film as appears lot of laughts, jokes, and  it reflected that friendship is the greatest thing that exists. \n\nBy the way, I´m sending the film together with this letter.

Many of the people habituated to use their own vehicle as their transport,where they can reach their destination in time . In the following paragraphs, I present my view in  this controversial issue.\n\nfirstly,We are having different modes of transport facilities, which among is road transport . As Automotive Industries are huge in market, most of the  house holders  prefer to buy a car rather than any other motor vehicle .They can have easy move from source to destination with in no time . And there need not to be depend on the  public transport of their journey. As private transport is increasing day by day, it's surprises that there may not be any public transport in up coming days. \n\nSecondly, if the private transportation is growing faster , the traffic is also going to create a major problem , which effects the global warming . And the income that  is getting through this servicing transport will automatically dropdown, which create a problem to the economy of the government. Another issue we can see here is unemployment. Most illiterate people choose their proficiency as  public  transportations like ,bus service, cab service, auto service....etc, in order to full fill their basic needs.People with more  unemployment may also lead to a crime rate .\n\n\nI hope, giving  equal priority for both public and private transportation makes healthy. And we can see that controlling traffic is not going out of the hands. ",

They persecute an American family that went because of the dad's job, which was something about a company that the natives from that place hated most. Without expecting it at all, this family went somewhere over Asia to start a new way of living. In other words, they had to get use to a different kind of world. \n\nIt wasn't that easy for the couple with two little girls. They had to escape with the doors from the country closed, while making sure both girls didn't get their minds full of junk (people killing). And in some of the scenes the little girl escaped or the dad had to make them jump from a building to another one!\n\nAnyways, I wouldn't want to ruin the ending but I would definitely recommend you to see what happens next!",

Besides, it’s also an environment problem, exhaust fumes engulfed the earth, more car is used, more exhaust gas release, we are killing our mother. \nIn addition, those who live on below average incomes do not have money to buy car.

  "text": "The future for the public transport shouldn't be  taken lightly,  in my opinion, the public transport is the best option for ending the problems with the traffic jam because when we use a bus or subway , a lot of people is travelling from one place at other in only one transport or vehicle. For many years the public transport had allowed that the people travel a long distance for work that otherwise would not be possible. Better still the future of the public transport is essential for a better life without traffic.  \nWhen we used the car, for general, one person is the unique who is accustomed to using your own car, so not is exploiting the potential of this car. At the time, we need more cars for more people, that's the meaning for more traffic. it's for this reason that I think the public transport is a great benefit for the society, and a good way for move us of the one place at other,  I suggest that  the government  has to give more means for the purpose of improving the public transport.

He had lived  near our town and I used to spend my holidays  with him, and, of course, I used to help him with his cows and rabbits, so I could do this work again for your company.\nFinally I think I’m a friendly woman who likes children and wants to work and learn this summer in U.S.A. so \nI look forward your answer soon\nFaithfully\n",

I am a serious fan of environment.\nI describe  how it looking my every day.

A bicycle is for me the best way how we can be do fit and a good condition and also to more less polution without cars.\nSecondly, I save water and electricity, because costs are quit expensive. So,my bills from water are inexpensive, because I swap to have a bath than take a shower. Next point is an issue, that if I am not at home  I do switch  off the temperature. I switch on a home  hiting for a temporary time, when I am working off I used more energy to warmht at home.\nNext point is a fact, that recycle glass and paper is most important. I tend to collect in three different boxes of waste, for paper,second for glas and plastic and third for rest rubbish. It's  a very  domestic and a huge issue for us life. We learn to really segreation of waste and in the future how e.g.:we could use second time a same glass.\nFinally, we are obligatory to care about the environment, because it's  us duty.\n",

This is to say that most part of cars are not green, namely,current cars are not designed for generate a good impact in the environment. Regarding the reason for the described situation is due to the strong economic interests of oil companies which are intended to get as much money as possible, regardless of the damage that they are causing to species of plants and animals. Thus, the question is, travelling by car is so much more convenient for whom? For multinational maybe? Or for some consumers that can afford a toxic and expensive car?, even though, when the public transport gets so crowded, is less harmful  indeed, in terms of the impact received by the environment,because it means more individuals in the same place,meanwhile each new car means increasingly pollute.

As a result roads are overloaded and long kilometres traffic jumps damage open air. On the one hand that quantuty of cars can't be forbidden, because it's personal right to have it or not. On the other hand the government should think about some measures for protecting environment. For example inventing severals special dates in a year for using only public transport. Also improving measure might be as an encreasing green areas in cities and towns.\nRivers and seas are in danger too. Unfortunately many tourists don't take care about saving personal spaces (on the river bank or on the sea beach) in clean. Factories damage nearest areas and water extremaly bad. In my opinion, firstly, new bilding on the banks must forbidden at all. Secondly, rules for tourists about caring environment must be very strick.\nI think, nature'll get the most important benefits if everybody takes care about own space in the best way.",

  "text": "\"The reality of transportation is that it is future oriented.If we're planning for what we have then we are behind the curve\", Anthony Fox. Transportation has a major role in a society as life revolves around motion. \n  When we talk about convenience, comfort and safety then private transport is more likely to consider. In certain emergency cases, running for a bus seems harder than jumping up in your own car. Private transport is totally on your own, so there remains no tension of reaching a certain station on a specific time.\n  Travelling privately makes one free of the issues as harrasment. Although many transport providers look forward to eradicate this problem, yet it remains.\n Public travelling may trouble the passengers due to increasing fares. People often tend to go on their own as private transport such as cars can be bought easily on loans provided by banks.\n  Looking on a wider span, cars are these days available according to the public demand.For instance, fuel-efficient, luxurious and economical cars are easily available.\n  With the advancement of the automobile industry, public transport will not be considered as the first choice in the coming years.The above discussion suggests that people find private transport a safer, convenient and comfortable mode of travelling.",

They think that year the student can spend in job to earn money so they can afford their expenses during college.This way helps them also to explore the job market,some jobs are in great demand compared to others. Or simply the student can spend this time travelling.This way help them to get rid of study stress, and to give time to their social life. \nOthers think that if students take a year off study is unwise. As return back to study may be difficult.It is better to finish study first then go for work or having relaxation with travel. \n both opinion have their merits.

There are mobile phone which has a face to face communication; the transportation driven by solar cell energy. In addition, the advancement of transportation system which is developed day-by-day performs to the most convenient and the fastest as they can. Even though the personal car was consumed more and more because of its convenient; in my opinion, unstoppable transportation development will perform public transport to be more popular than travelling by car.\n\nThe number of people in the world is continually increased. This makes the city be crowded. Imagine if everyone has individual cars, may we walk on the top of the car to meet neighbour by the next door. Therefore, public transportation is deemed significant in order to reduce density on the road, the traffic. \n\nIn the first paragraph, I've written that the transportation development will never lose place for public transport. Firstly, there are a lot of methods to travel; for example, buses, trolley buses, Metro, BTS, train, ship. Secondly, public transport improve itself to be more functional and help support people. For example, comfortable seats, system support for the handicap or physical disability, time capture that help people to know the fix time when the bus come, as well as security support that help people to be more confident to travel. Lastly, public transportation make you sure to arrive on time. You do not worried about the traffic jam, or try to find the car park.\n\nAll taken into account, the public transport has a much more useful and convenient, both individuals and commercial. Although the personal car is popular, the public transport is still be valuable for the country ",

This  is China-based chain that is recently opened. This restaurant has many awards in China before it opened in Jakarta. The place of Huang Ji Huang is pretty big if you compared with the other restaurants in PIK. The place is provided private room and karaoke room in one place. Besides that the public room is also clean and comfortable, but I recommend you to choose private room to support our farewell dinner . The waiters who worked here are kind and helpful, they serve the customers kindly and always explain the menu clearly, they  are capable make their customer satisfied with the service. Huang ji huang specialized in the stew pots menu, which will take you to enjoy an authentic Chinese food. You can order packages menu that Huang Ji Huang offered or you can also choose the ingredients that you want for your stew pot but you must choose 3 until 5 ingredients. Huang Ji Huang has 5 kinds of sauce which can give your stew pot become tasteful, and one of them is Mala Sauce. Mala Sauce is a spicy flavor and it is very authentic and you will rarely find this taste in another restaurant. But if you do not like spicy you can also try  the Honey Sauce. After all the food is very tempted to try and the size portion is big enough to share with 3 or 4 people. The price is cheap if you compare it with the service and taste from the food. Having farewell dinner here is worth the money.  Every month Huang Ji Huang always make a special offer from their cutomer , and for this month Huang Ji Huang will give 20% discount for customer who spend 500 IDR above, for a complete  informatioj you can check it on the website or call the restaurant. And I highly recommend  you to make a reservation first if you decided to hold our dinner here, because this place is always crowded and we also need a private room . ",

  "text": "Nowadays, Ways of live have being Changing in many aspects. Does why, is easy to believe that if things continue with this rhythm and transforming everything, in a closer future of 50 years everything is gonna be completely knew and different.\n\nIn the past, people were used to live the instant without concerning about the future. Lives of everybody were the same and just some of them thought that what they were doing in that moment would have consequences in the future. For that, everything were kind of similar and static for many years. But then industrialization comes and with that, the technology, so ways of life's started to change and everything start to go faster.\n\nAs I told you before because of the technology many things has become able in less time, and with the pass of the years this tend to increase. For example, sharing knowledge and experiences allows that everybody can do or apply things and develops faster. Also allows that researches can be share easily or for example you can get information about environmental problems that can affect you as we'll so you can react faster and make some changes.\n\nAnother example of why lives are gonna changed completely in 50 years is because also that connection between others cultures make People concern more about her own health, the expectations of life and the way they want to live it, because everyday will be easier to see how much are we hearting the earth so we will see faster the impacts that this brings to our life. As a result we will be need to change fast, to try to fix what we broke and star to rebuild in order to have that future or health that we dream of.\n\nLeast but no less, family perception , has being changed and for that time everything will be different because will be the effect of the decisions that women are making right now about having kinds. They are tending to work as much as men's, so is hard to have time for building a family or even some times is hard too, thinking about getting married. So that, maybe wouldn't be young force worker in 50 years and people will spend all their time and money in their hobbies, sports, self care and traveling.\n\n\n",

University education is good for the students but they also need to learn industry specific skills. Students , for example learn many theories, which may not be required at their place of work. New skills like analytics and data management are in demand. In my opinion, what is expected is a new role for teachers but not their disappearance from classrooms.

There are three main reasons for supporting my idea. Firstly, for the long-distance, the car is not as convenient as airport. for example, if you go to another city by car, you may spent more than two days on the way. On the contrary, airport just cost your two hours, and you can go to your destination. The time spending of taking airport is lower than taking car. Secondly, consuming car is not a normal thing for part of developing or undeveloped country. The fee of buying car and fuel oil is expensive for poor people. Thus, it is important to use public transport because it is much cheaper than private car, and everyone can consume.Thirdly, the global warming is a serious issue for human who live in the earth. Air pollution is the main causes for global warming. The great number of using private car leads to higher level of air pollution, and the public transport is one of the best solutions for decreasing the air pollution. To sum up, there are numerous benefits to use public transport, and it will not disappear. ",

I can understand how difficult this decision must be. However, if I were you, I would do what I have always want. And I know which matter you've always been interested: music. I remember when you told me once you was playing a violin for four hours. \n\nSo, a good idea would be to keep yourself doing creative things. Anyway, you could always do any sport in your extra-free time. As it's often said: a good body makes a good mind. \n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you again.

Now I´m going to talk about the benefits o learning another language.\nI am from spain so my foreign language is Spanish\nI start to study another language when I was a child, I started learning English because every one said that English is the future language, when I finished my school time I tried to study French but it was so difficult for me.\n I have to say that study another language give you more opportunities  because on these days you need to now other language to look for a work and be more inteligent than your college to take the work and that’s great. \nAnd to day is necessary because if you want to travel around the world and meet people and have conversation with their you need to now more than your foreign language, because in the rest of the world and particularly in Europe people now more than two language and that great.\nI think learning other language never have drawbacks because all you learn is good for you and your main, you never stop to now new things.\n",

However I do not agree with them because in most part of the world mass transport system is still popular and they are environment friendly and cost efficient. \n\nFirstly, Public bus service is very popular in most part of the world. In most part of the Europe, people still prefer public bus instead of car to travel. \nSecondly, public transport are environmentally sound in comparison to private vehicle. It carries more people while private vehicle carries fewer people. Public bus do not let more cars to contaminate environment. \nFinally, Public transport's cost efficient. People need to spend more money on fuel if they want to travel same destination by private vehicle.\n\nIn conclusion, although car is convenient to travel, it is not enough to finish the future of public transportation.

I have recently bought an electric car in sustitution of my traditional car. An electric car is less harmful for the environment. When I go out to the camp, if I lunch there, I take care of cleaning the ground. I like nor the dirty people neither the dirty places.

  "text": "Military service is the military training which needs people have to join army or voluntary for a period of time. In Korean, people should completed military service at least 2 years. Similarly, people have to join it 1 year in Taiwan. It is a debate that should everyone have to complete military service when they reach 18 years old. With supporters maintaining that it is important for national security and make people maturity，whilst opponents claim that the military service have effects on study and should have freedom of choice.\n\nFirstly，every countries acquire stabilization must be protected by a stronger armed forces for national security. If the war or other dangerous threat the safety of country，they can not get help from other countries immediately. Therefore，people accept military service could be easier to protect their country. Especially some small population of country have policy that is people need join military service due to develop into a powerful country. \nSecondly, the important for people become maturity when they completed military service, which probably is a particular experience for 18 years old. In addition to have hard physical training and get different special skills，people also can improve personal quality in military service. Consequently，people could be more independent and strong，they seems to earlier become mature than other people who do not completed military service.\n\nIn contrast, opponents of military service point out that study is the first vital thing for people who reach 18 years old. Military service mainly to improve physical，however study might be completed better in school at the age because it has professional teacher team and a good study atmosphere，people usually easier to concentrate on learning knowledge. For instance, some countries allowed people join military service after their all courses was finished. \n\nAdditionally, critics argue that countries are able to allow people have freedom of choice for military service. Relatively some people unwilling join military service，people volunteered in a military service possibly enjoy it. Furthermore，it also can respect for right s of people，especially for women who do not can adapt the hard training.  \n\nIn conclusion, it can be concluded that military service is necessary for national security and good for people improve themselves. The best course of action would be government attempt to allow people volunteered in conscription when they completed their studies.  \t\t  \n\n",

I went to my apartment and turn on my TV and I watch in the news that the bandit escaped with 3 paintings. I decided to solve the case. I went to the museum and follow all the tracks that I found were a broken sculpture. I search for any clue and I found something, it was a piece of paper with an address on it. I follow the address and when I get there it appears to be an abandon house. I decided to wait, and hide on the bushes if I see someone entering. In the night I see a shadow entering the house. I carefully approached the window of the house and I see two men with the paintings. They left the house on a truck. I follow them in a taxi. We were on the terminal of New York it was a very famous landmark. There were a lot of commuters on the terminal so I lost the two men. I located the instantly because I recognize their hats. I was focal to them. They threaten all the people cruelly so all the sightseers were angry with them. However the modernization of the terminal was unknown to me so I was completely lost. We entered on a train, the ceiling was comfortable but everyone was objecting of the two men.

After waiting an hour the time comes and bravely  with high confident level he walke to the office. Suddenly his water floaded and tears drop from his eyes. The interviewer who is sitting infront of him was a person with blue eyes that he really loves.The situation suddenly changed . Peter without doubt hugged the intertiewer who is a man about 4o years old. The man who is crying together with him was his father that have leave peter and his mom because they had divorce 6 years ago. Then the interview became a meeting between father and a son that really touched. Killed two birds with a stone is a perfect idiom to describe Peter's situation because he got his beloved father back and still can pursue his dream to studies in ireland.q",

People complaint about how the information about different TV shows don't contribute in the process of learning, that's why many of This programmes are considered trash, because of the multiples shows such as realities, talk shows,or showbiz that hardly ever have a good message or something interesting for people. \nA good example of this shows are how people are paid to act in realities or talk show where they show exaggerated or hilarious familiar problems, where the only aim is to get more audience.  Another good example are the endless showbiz that are appeared recently, this type of programs where the information is often gossip about personal life of famous singers and actors without taking into count if they are true or not.\nIt's a pity to know that exist just a few programs that try to educate people with the most update information through documentaries, investigations, cultural or opinion programs, which in my opinion help to acquire more knowledge.

This story was shown a murder who completed the mission: killed everyone that he hated. At last, only one person could be alive even those sacrificed had tried to escape this horrible result. This is a combined story of horror and comedy.\n\n  I cannot find a word to describe this film easily, what can I say is you will be regret if you miss this film. This first reason is all actors shown their talent in this film directly and audience can follow their steps and the story certainly, this essential element which also makes a big success to the film. Besides, the attractive story line makes a lot of climax so that everyone can finish this film from the beginning to the end and creates the billion box office to this film. However, I think the tools should be improved, such as killer’s knife and actors'costumes, the knife looks like as brittle as a handicraft, I believe those are seconded-handed clothing. I think this is a pity to this movie.\n\n  At last, your bravery can be improved after watching this film. What are you waiting for? Go and check it out!\n",

Besides, the price of petrol is increasing too, and it likely will be as expensive that most people not be able to afford a car.\nIn contrast, there will be cheaper alternatives as bus, train or even plane for long distances.\nIn other hand, many drivers enjoy travelling by his vehicle because they like to drive and they feel free.\nFinally goberments and society are concerned about the environment and I consider that they will decrease levels of pollution and co2 emitions.\nFrom my point of view public transport will not disappear even if cars are much more comfortable, faster and more evolved than now.

They lived in a big house with a lovely swimming pool where we can swim and play. At the end of the summer, I have kept on seeing these boys to help them during the school year.\n\nThis experience helped me a lot because I become much more responsible not only with these boys but also with my brothers and sister (I had two brothers and one sister)and I have learned the meaning to work and receive money. \n\nI didn't have problems because the children were quiet and respectful, and also because I known them since they were newborn.\n\nI hope to have satisfied to all your questions.

As the technologies world is moving fast and the auto mobile industry is also coming with new variant of cars & scooters in very economical way. Buying cars and scooters are more convenient than the last decade. In few decade people earnings and living style have also changed. People now buying cars and scooters as per their convenience and pocket. Earlier people used to buses, taxes, autos for reaching offices, schools, colleges, shopping etc. Which was time consuming and obliviously cheaper way of commuting from one place to other. Since today worlds is time saving world hence people don't care about their pocket. Using personal veihicles is more convenient to them than using public transport. So the public transports importance is reducing every day. If it so their will a time when single people will not interested for public transport. This has tremendous impact on other aspect. Fuel consumption has increased in few years. Net of cars and bikes is reason for heavy traffic jam every side. Ratio of road accidents has been increased in few decades. People not even care about safety parameters while driving on road. I must say that Public transport is life line in today worlds.",

But, in this moment the people think different, is to start to help the world and \n\nContamination is big problem for us and the planet. In the past the people bought thing, and they didn't care how is dangerous for the planet. Now, the people is more conscious and they know how dangerous is for the planet. Also, TV, radio, internet, big companies has adverisement for helping the planet. Moreover, schools since kindergarten is educating for clean the planet, simply like separate the garbage.\n\nObesity and other thins about help, is a topic very important because the people is dying for this problem.For example, the form to prepare the food, is gonna be dangerous because a lot food have artificial thing that is no good for us.  To turn to, alredy people cook the food in form organic o with products more naturally without chemical. But this kind of food is expensive and the people cannot buy.\n\nTechnology has good thing and bad things. The technology is advancing very fast, in the best way this is good for us because we wiill do a lot of thing. Maybe, in 2060 we will be able to go to the moon very easy, like go to Europe. Also, the cars will fly, and maybe is better for the city. \n\nIn conclusion I think that we on track for the next years. Compared with the past the people is more conscious and is worries for the world. As a result for that we going to have a better life, more healty and clean for the next years.

So I was just thinking how to convince her. there was no other option for me i just want her. during the exam time ,i was thinking whole time how to communicate with her. When the examination is over, again I started to talk with her,asking how was your exam. She told me not good at all, but my was good and she also added that you may got the chance and finally I got it.After three days later our result has been published and I got the chance but the girl didn't. Then I become too much unhappy. I expected if both of us get the chance then it will be very good.But alas ! my dream didn't come true. When I was returning from syleth I called the girl and talk to her and assure that I got chance in university but girl says that she knew it.",

  "text": "My Favourite Sport. \nWe are living in rush world. All of us have to choose some activity. In my opinion it's have to be like brushing teeth. We do it for hygiene! My hygiene is running or more familiar word is Jogging. Run Forest Run! It is the most simple form of activity. Jogging has existed since  the beginning of the earth. I can say that is the most natural move for human.  All that you need for become Runner its motivation and plan. That what was happened with me personally. Motivation for my been 15k run competition. But I never before have work our Jogging. So for finish competition with pleasure I needed work out plan witch is diary day by day about our jogging distance, time, mood during work out. First of all it is absolutely minimum, you just need boots for run! It is one main condition, rest of your dress are not important. Shoes are for protect and prevent your health, you have got only one body look after them. I enjoyed my favourite sport because I feel better after Jogging I think better and I meet lovely great people because of running. My advice is : eat a lot of vegetables and fruit , drink plenty of water and run at least 3 times per week.      ",

  "text": "In the past, cars are only affordable for the upper level while for the middle class and lower there are not many choice for them beside walk and public transportation. Since technology and standard of living are improved, many people left the traditional habit in using public transportation and choosing car for several reasons. The first one is to preserve time. As we know public transportation has not a direct way to fulfill our all destinations then it force us to stop in many stations first, moreover we should take the other one to reach our destination so it is already obvious why using a car is better. Secondly, public transportation usually very crowded and make us not feel safe since there is an opportunity for us to be theft. Then by car we can enjoy the scenery, share laugh, change our destination by sudden and many more. For these reasons, it cannot be doubted if people think a car is more comfortable to be used rather than public transportation.\n\nSince cars are affordable nowadays, a family can have more than one that make the number of car growing rapidly but they do not think further about the negative side effects that a car has. Firstly, it leading us to global warming since the concentration of pollution are higher in many countries, moreover actually it is not only leading but also make global warming faster and also can threat our health. Then roads are more crowded right now and there are so many traffics so people wasted longer time in the road, then it makes one of the positive points of using a car is gone and the importance of public transportation is needed. While in the statement is written that public transportation will be left by many people, in my opinion is the opposite that public transportation is our future. It can be proved by now that the willingness of people to use public transportation is higher, beside it is not as costly as using a car, the quality of public transportation are improved so citizen have no worry using it.\n",

I recommend read  different ideas. Anyway, if you read different books you can understand better. In conclusion, it's very important to learn the concept than saying something stupid....

I was very inconfident about myself and i can’t make friends well so I think that it’s too difficult to ask teachers or friends. I  always try to find out reasons which take a lot of time. Moreover, I need to improve my skills such as reading, listening, writing, and speaking, they help me to catch up on my teacher’ s lesson. Secondly, studying in university, I have to live far from house which make me be homesick, sad, and worried I have to live in dormitory with many strange friends, they ‘re very noisy and I have to share my room with my roommates. It’s not convenient. Everyday, I have to clean our room , wash clothes, I must take a lot of time to finish  everything before I star learning. The first time living here, i used to called my family and complained about here’s life. However, life’s university have many conveniences. Living alone, I have to manage money well. Before I want to pay money for something, I always think carefully that I’m really necessary or not. Sometimes, I broke up nearly and I was really worried so I have to pay money suitably. When I living alone, I have to save money because there are many situations which I have to slove without family, and you can become a good person with many good characters such as confident, independent, friendly. Because my family always prepared everything for me when I lived with them so it’s very difficult to be independent. But today, I have to do it , I have to solve my problem, manage money, wash clothes by myself. In addition, I  can be confident because teachers require everybody in class have to stand in front of class and speak English. Living alone you have to make friends when you’re sad. Studying new lessons from society.\n",

At an other day I go jogging with my best friend, so we talk a lot and have fun while we do sport.\n\nJogging is a sport you can start it every day. You don't need a lot of aquitment, so you don't have to buy a lot.\nI think for people who are fat, they can go jogging but a little bit slowler. \n\nYou have to notice that and go tomorrow jogging.

That’s because pollution has now reached critical levels and that’s why we must take it under control and solve it.\nWe already know that a great part of the pollution comes from the exhaust fumes of the transports that invade cities worldwide. However, we can already fight this – waiting the developing of advanced technology which can better exploit renewable,  sustainable energy.  – for example taking advantage of public transports. The best idea is still, obviously, valorizing the use of bicycles. \nApart from that, even greater is the pollution of seas and rivers. Polluting them is like endangering the life of the whole world. This is caused by the waste of factories, but also by the damages that tankers do not only to the sea, but to the mainland too.\nIn addition, what about domestic wastes, which are our reality? We should all learn to manage our wastes, because each of us, in our own small, is a great damage for the environment. \nIn conclusion, I think it is never too late for saving our wonderful world. Why not do it now?\n",

It’s placed in a quiet street, so the restaurant is often very relaxing, especially between 8 and 9 pm.\n\tThe furniture consists in a set of chairs, tables and some sofas, covered with red clothes. The restaurant appears very elegant and traditional.\n\tUsually, there is no music in the restaurant. The owner prefers to leave on only the TV, but often the dining room is silent. In this way, customers can have the chance to have a conversation, without being annoyed by television or music. I find it appreciable: I really love to talk to the people I’m eating with.\n\tDespite this, the resaturant is decorated with a full set of musical instruments, hanged up to the walls. I really like it, because I love music and I enjoy trying to guess which instrument I’m looking to.\n        You can eat different types of pizza, starters and pasta there. Everything is delicious and very tasting, especially pizzas: they dress them in many different ways: I try a different meal every time I go there. At last, it is not expensive at all.\n",

But, fortunately, people living in this area all use these bikes carefully, so we don't care so much that thing. Second facility is public bus. Large of bus all around the city. When students finish their class, they take but to home. Worker are off duty, taking bus to home, too. And when the weekend is coming. Family can take the bus to place to place, instead of driving. It makes farther or mother more convenient! Third, lots of green area. Taichung have plenty of tree at the park. So when children are playing around these tree, they can feel more healthy with pure air. And that's talk about the bigger area, Taiwan. Taiwan has a complete traffic system.

This is  a time , when parents could create behaviour of their children, because when they grow up, they are beginning rebel and do  things which are good in their opinion.\nSecondly, for behaviour of older children like teenagers have an impact other factors, it are not only their parents but other people, whose surrond them. It is a time when children must choose, which people are good or bad, which way they will go to difficult situation for example they will be drink alcohol or they will have fun without any suplements. When they choose bad, they could began stopped do things  which were important for them in previous period in their life.\nIn summary, I would like to point out that the most impact for young people have their own, because life is a time when people only choosing.

  "text": "Nowadays our world is fighting everyday against diferrent problems, one day there is the problem of violence, one day the atmosphere conditions or many others. Today we can try to imagine how our lives can change in the next 50 years, if it will be better or worse. In my opinion everyone's life will have a great improvement, from the economic point of view but also from the social and cultural one. It is known that in the future will come the day in which any kind of unrenewable resource will finish. But I imagine that in the next years we can begin to spread the use of alternative resources, as the eletricity given by the light of the sun rays. Or in addition, we can use the energy given by the environment, as the wind or the inorgainc rest. Maybe there will be also great new discoveries from the medicine that will make disappear any kind of diseases. To sum up, I think that we have to expect a great future in which men will regain possession of his whole capability and thanks to it he will change everyone's lives in best.",

I think it's good idea if you buy some kits for football and training with your friend before match at home or playground for two or three days.

Also, during your journey, you might be able to stay night in your own car. But nowadays, cars are one of the reasons to cause the earth warming and air pollution. Car companies try to spread electric cars but it seemed to take a long time. And some people have already switched to use public transport like trains or buses. Moreover, it's still popular to travel long journey with trains or ships because the scenery you can see from them are totally different from the one from cars. According to these reasons, I don't think there is no future for public transport.",

  "text": "Last Friday I’ve visited Balla without any planning. I usually wake up at 10 am at that day my father called me at 8:00 am and asked me to go Balla with them. He usually avoids me in this kind situation. Nowadays he treats me as botheration. That is why I was very surprised. The reason he told me to go Balla is Noman will feel alone there as Badhon and her mother is not going. I was in a bit hesitation latter decide to go. Actually I don’t have enough courage to say no to my father. I got ready very quickly so I didn’t do my morning exercises.\nWe have been told earlier that Abul kaka has got a very nice PAJERO Jeep from office nonetheless the performance of the vehicle was awful that day. It shut down at the road for several times while we were on the way. So I was feeling very anxious that if the car fail in Aricha highway. Because I was so sure Abul kaka and Noman will prefer Aricha highway rather than the Singair road. I don’t feel comfortable in hi-ways for many reasons. Those are the most risky roads of the country. if there is an alternate way I always use that. That’s why when I go to village I like to use the Singair Road than DHAKA-ARICHA highway. My father also uses this road. When I was a youngster, my father and I rode motorcycle to visit our place using this road. As I was a kid I fall asleep sometimes. May be for that I have a high regard for the road.\nnoman engaged the front seat. Though he was unwilling to sit there as because abul kaka or my father should be seated there. But they insist him. So we four were occupying the back seat uncomfortably. When the car stopped to take oil at a service station near Gilando, my father asked me to go the very back benches of the jeep. I thought I shouldn’t come as because those benches were disgraceful for me. I feel like I’m depriving by my family. If I were in a better position it could not happen to me. Peoples humiliate me in many ways because I do nothing for earnings. I found it very painful when my parents do it to me. I keep my brain cool and try to overcome the situation by thinking one day I will prove myself. I know who I am and what I’m doing. My thoughts are unquestionably better than others. Hence I’m waiting for good time. \nWe reached our home at 1:00 pm as well as planned to back Dhaka at 4:00 pm. It gives the impression that only going and coming in a big car is the main purpose of the tour. That was ridiculous. That the I spent most of my time with Noman with his over talking habit. My usual stance with this kind of person is to listen. We visited nagar chak with much anticipation. In this season I kike to see the sun shine. The crystal clear and mild sun is very favorite of mine. While I was listening noman I was discerning  that I should question more. When he talks he has done many mistakes because of his over talking habit. \nat 4:00 pm we set for Dhaka was an early move because of faulty car. I fall asleep as soon as we crossed jhitka bazar in addition when I wake up we had crossed Tora bridge. We stopped our car to a road side tea stall to take tea. Than we set for Dhaka. We talked about a lot of things. When we talked to our seniors I think I should control myself though they talked unreal things. They prefer industrialization over nature. At the same time they also keep saying that nature was more green and vigorous in our time. A never ending argument took places and thus we reached Dhaka.\n",

For example, if you are in a hurry and want to catch the place you are heading to, you can drive as fast as possible. You can have some other choices that you can stop to buy something: water, juice or snack if you get hungry your way or thirsty. You even can take a rest for awhile pleasingly to sleep or to have a nap. You wouldn't suffer anymore from the trouble or annoying stuff on bus most of the time like: no room for you to sit, bad smell people can make, or get bothering or bushing. It's convenient already. \n\nBut, on the other hand, because of recently traffic has been terrifically unbearable; cars are so many; very noisy, unclear air produced has become the public transport better to save earth.

  "text": "Last week from September 11 to September 21, we had a minivaction. From September 11 to September 14, I did nothing besides watching TV, taking care of my little sister Ellie and chat with my friends. On the rest of the boring week, I solved a 1000 pieces puzzles. On Sunday, my family and I went to Causeway Amador then to Albrook Mall.\n\nAfter the examns finished, I went home and had nothing to do, so I thought that I needed to watch my dramas because it was a week I haven't watch them due to the exam week. So after watching all my dramas, I had nothing to do. From September 12 to September 14, I was too lazy because I was tired of the exam so I was all day laying on the sofa doing nothing apart of watching the TV and chat with my friends. Besides I needed to take care of my little sister Ellie, who is very cute and funny and right now she is always trying to get up and stand and walk. \n\nOn the rest of the boring week, I was watching TV and suddenly my cousin found some pieces of the puzzle inside the cabinet, so I decided to solve my Paris puzzles with my sister, which was less than a half solved for about one year but it had too much color in the sky so I didn't finished then a year ago. We began to solve it again and took us the whole week to finish it. While solving the puzzle, I decided to count how much pieces was left, after counting them I realized that five pieces were missing. I was too angre because I was finishing the puzzles and five pieces were missing so I began to search the whole house for the five pieces but didn't find it. On Saturday, I finished my puzzle but with five pieces missing but I was happy too. I finished it.\n\nOn Sunday, my father planned to take my whole family to Causeway Amador. Also my uncle, aunt, grandfather and cousins went with us. After arriving to the Causeway, my brother and my cousins went to drive bicycle for one hour. I was hoping that my father can teach me to drive the car but was not possibly because we went to Albrook Mall to eat and my father didn't want to return to Causeway Amador to teach me drive.\n\nMini vacation can be fun but sometimes boring because you haven't planned anything for the vacation. The best thing I did was to solve my beautiful Paris puzzles and went to Amador with my family and have a good time with them. Mini vacation are a break for us to have a fun and good moment with our adorable and lovely family and friends.",

Vesuvium - this is the vulcano's name! - covered it with a lot of cinder so that walls, houses, food, clothes, corps of citizens has been preserved as well they were. \nYou can walk through the same streets and enter in the same shops the romans entered some centuries ago! It isn't incredible? Besides is possible to book special tours in which there are guides dressed like pompei's citiziens. I love the overnight tour, in which only fires light the ruins.

Days are getting  longer but night are getting shorter and lighter. We convert our watches an hour ago in October. It`s pleased some people because they will be able to sleep an hour more.

It became a big problem now.  I always want to see the world, to swim in the Ocean. However I am stopped last tragic developments  in foreign countries .

They're more for self-defense but for what I do, and my way to stay healthy, is martial arts and running. As far as watching, that's a good question. I would suppose I would have to say, in Japan Sumo is my favorite sport for watching. I've never tried it myself.

More time that you don´t have that assistance is going to be more difficult improve your style and enjoy swimming more because if you really know how to swim are going to have more resistance in the water.\n",

  "text": "Last week was a hard week for my wife.\nShe works at a language school in local University. It is just the beginning of winter vacation courses, so she has been struggled with a lot of work and students.I think, that may the reason she had the Sleep Paralysis last night. In Korea, we call it 'Ka-Wee-Nool-Rim' which means being pressed by 'Ka-wee' ghost. Yes, she actually felt as if someone was pressing down on her chest by hands. Even she was not able to lift single finger tip as if she was turned into a stone statue. She opened her eyes. Then, she realized that four indistinct strangers were staring at her as standing just beside bed. She was so scared and frightened. She tried screaming and calling me who was sleeping peacefully beside at her. But she couldn't. She couldn't open mouth, say anything at all. Even worse, two of them started whispering on her ears, die…die..\n                                                                         \nWell, actually it didn't happen. She just dreamed a terrible nightmare because I was not sleeping. I was watching a YouTube clip by my iPad.\nShe reproached me for not awaking her up despite she had been calling me so eagerly.\nBut it is not true. She hadn't called me at all. It was just a dream, very real like.\n \nMost of those dreamers claim that it is like real.\nThey think they really opened eyes and awaken since it is too vivid and detailed.\nOften they explains and describe the scene in detail like a cup on table, friends who watching TV beside them, room light and so on.\nBut nothing is real. They realize that no cup is on table, no one is at room, and the light is off.\n \nCommonly, the dreamers say that they;\n \n - experience when they are so tired physically and so stressed.\n - feel drowning down when they are about falling in sleep(so they know it will happen)\n - feel a lot of press on body and cannot move in dream.\n - see someone or some people as standing beside or riding on them.\n - feel the dream is so vivid and real.\n - repeatedly dream again if they rarely awake themselves.  \n                                                \nSome experience so easily and often.

Initially, we had some problems because the resistors did not increase the temperature enough to warm the water. The next week we go to prepare some material for to resolve this problems.

Beginning in one of the complete parts that I preferred and liked I'm going to write about the Ice age. It was a period of time in earth's history when temperatures fell globally, causing ice sheets and glaciers to form far from the north and south pole.",

But before the lesson, he has to lunch with his family and leading the dog from the veterinary for his annual vaccine. Peter gets a fast lunch in ten minutes, other two minutes for finding the bike and putting the dog on the basket; at the office of the veterinary three people wait, so Peter is forced to wait. After an hour the dog is vaccined and taken at home, but her mother needs a milk bottle. Unfortunately Anne, her sister, has just taken the bike, so he's forced to walk until the nearest supermarket. Peter's mother needs a special kind of milk without lactose, and the market behind home doesn't have it. So Peter had to make a choice: going at the lesson or waiting his father for getting to take the milk with the car? After an exhausting afternoon, Peter has a bit of luck, infact his father Jack has just came back from the work, so he could get to take the milk and giving him a passage. With a little delay, but Peter did it!",

There are many countries which should be complete the military service when people who reach 18 such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore. The duration of the military service should be around 12 mouths to 20 mouths. Also, there are different sections of training during the military service people generally do a lot of training to their obedience or how to use the weapons. Thus, there is a cause of agreement and another cause of disagreement which is freedom of choice and mental maturity.\n \nAs this topic, the one of the reason of everyone should not have to complete the military service because the freedom of choice. Some people may think it seem to be a human rights that let the people to choose if they want to join the military. Otherwise, when the people are forced by the government, they probably feel the freedom of choice is restricted. So some counties would not force the people to join military.\n\nIn contrast, it could be the benefit that improves their mental maturity. If people join the military service when they just 18, it may learn a lot of life skills as there are quite a high claim in the military and the chancellor who work in the military may request to the soldiers that everything frequently be regular. For instance, they usually need them to fold up a quilt in a specified angle or there is specific time that you must wake up and get sleep. People should not be complaining about anything even if they seem to be right. But after a period of time, people could develop their obedience especially to the young people; they will be likely to become a more independent person.\n\nTo conclude with both sides, there are reasons to effect by people should or should not have to complete military service. However; the effects may different which is base on how length of the duration. \n",

  "text": "First of all Television has less viewers now days. Most of the people turn to the Internet website or applications like Netflix or Youtube. Now let's go back to those days when young people still watch television for entertainment . There were a lot of programs on television. Most of the people watched news, movies, or tv shows on television. Also there was a lot of different channel that we chose. As I remember there were educational channel like Discovery and National Geography. Those channel always content a lot of new technology. For some people may think that only these kind of channel can provide educational knowledge and for some people they don't consider watching these channel as entertainment. For these kinds of channel are both entertainment and educational.\nBut I won't opine that these are the only channels that can provide knowledge. All kinds of shows can give you all kinds of different knowledge even when you watch movies. But of course there will be some channel that is not suitable for child under 18 or just for adult. As I think there is no channel that you can't learn form it. All kinds of programs have something that you can think about just depend on how you look at it.\nSo television entertains, but can it also educate ? Yes of course but only when you look at it as a way you wanna learn something.",

This action would decrease the gas emitted to the environment.\nIn addition, the water issue is another big problem. Nowadays, people is wasting water instead of saving it. One basic solution for this point is try to not take a shower for so much time but taking it with a bucket and a few minutes. Another solution is to not waste water while we are washing dishes. We should use another bucket for this task.\nTalking about rubbish, it is very important to separate it in the following types: metal, plastic, organic, glass and cardboard in order to make the collection task easy for the dustman. However, we also have to try to not create more rubbish recycling most of them. For example, the organic rubbish can be used as fertilizer, the metal scrap can be taken to the melting factory as well as the glass.\nTherefore, the environment is not going to recover  if we do not decide to take our part in this global problem.\n\n",

First of all, boat moves across the sea and the sea is very beautiful. For instance, when we move on the sea, we can see many types of animals, such as birds, turtles, and fishes. Next, the boat usually is very big, so we can do many activities on it, such as dancing, drinking. Finally, It is the safest way for travel, because we do not have many dangers, such as crashing, falling any other kinds of danger in the sea. Therefore, I prefer the boat to travel, instead of the train or the plane. All in all, travel in the sea with a boat can be very interesting and comfortable, in addition, it is very safety. I advise you to travel by boat if you have enough money for it.",

For example, if we completely relaying to use cars it is going to increase the gasoline uses. Apparently it is going to make more pollution more global warming issue. How ever, using cars makes the life easier but when everyone or every house they will own at least three cars it is too much. Although the traffic jams the accidents etc.. . \n\n public transport it is really important and it has a lot of advantages for helping humanity. In my opinion every country they should have different kind of public transport \nbuses, subways , and trains. For instance San Francisco it is a great example for incredible city, the variety of choices in the public transport it is remarkable. In spite of the cost of these facilities it is going be expensive but it is necessary. \n\nIn conclusion , The governments should work on that because the people need the public transport and the world for the environment , life expanses it is much cheaper than having a car.

Simple, the new generation decided do take your driving licence and I saw this around me, my colleagues, my friends, my family. It´s just a question of time when everybody will have a car. This afirmation: travelling by car is so much more convenient say everything, for example if we think a lot of time we spent on wait bus to arrive our destiny, the traffic is a lot of things that everyone prefer  buy car it more practical and fast.\nDon't forget the cust. In my opinion the price of the ticket on bus is expensive. Every year the price of public transport turn it up. We can stop and do a mental arithmetic and we can see a lot of many we spend one year. If we have a car I believe we don't spend much money. It's just my opinion because this is my life so I now what I am talking about. Every months a buy my pass for use on the bus.

  "text": "In the argument, the author asserted that the city should prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza. The author claimed that the business dropping causes by the increasing number of skateboarded users. Likewise, the skateboarded users brought numerous garbage that affects the stores in the plaza. Based on author’s two concern, the statement that drew a conclusion to prohibit skateboarding in Central Plaza is not a thoughtful and wise decision.\nFirst of all, it is a contradiction in the argument. If more skateboarded users are willing to go to Central Plaza, there are more customers to help the growth of business. It is against author’s assertion. From this point view, the decreasing of business should cause by other factors, but not skateboarded users. However, there are many reasons can cause the business dropping. Probably, the stores are too old in Central Plaza which could not attract customers walk into, and have to renovate. Furthermore, the produce sales in the stores that couldn't fit customers’ need. Those above reasons could influence the business in Central Plaza directly. \nSecond, author claimed that the sanitation problem caused by skateboarded users is not only happen by specific person, whenever more customers should bring more waste and wrongdoing. Those problems appeal that there are not sufficient securities in Central Plaza. \nMoreover, the problem would case by skateboarding immediately is the skateboarded users take over pedestrian walking space. To solve this problem, the city should set up more space and facilities for skateboarding, and divide the different space for walking and skateboarding.\nTo sum it up, the author’s prediction won’t happen if the city prohibits skateboarding. In contact author’s concerns, the increasing skateboarded users would bring more potential to improve the business in Central Plaza. On the other hand, the author should provide profound discussion why people come to Central Plaza don’t shop there. The condition of the stores and safety are two crucial factors to affect the business in the plaza. To strengthen author’s conclusion, the author should put the factors above in the argument.\n",

Our team won this match. We were happy with this. My advice for someone who want to play this game, you don't have to be tall or fast, when you play you have to think a lot. I enjoy this game because the most important thing is team work, you have to understand each other. It's really important to be tall because you will score point faster and better. My favourite player is Marcin Gortat. He is Polish basketball player. He is really tall hi have 202 centimeters. My story with basketball were very short.

  "text": "This issue is not clear-cut on both money and job satisfaction are important in deciding career in our life. I think that on balance it is more important to try to get satisfaction.\nFirst, happiness comes from inside our mind. We work eight hours a day so if we submerge in a bloody pond in a long time could definitely turn ourselves frustrated. I would choose a job with satisfaction.\nIn my own case, I am working as a co-cook in a diner. Cooking has been my favorite in my life. Costumers’ satisfaction brings me happiness. Although the heat in the kitchen could burn us, the smile on the customers gives the best courage.\nAlso, the satisfaction from the customers pushes me to work harder and be better on my job. Job satisfaction could make us to purchase perfection. The more I can perform the much I can gain. As a result, job satisfaction is a good way to get better paid. I believe I could someday become a chef in my own restaurant and serve my customer a fabulous dish. \nOn the whole, therefore, I feel that it is best to go for a career that we will enjoy if this is possible.\n",

  "text": "I do agree television advertising direct toward young children should not bet allowed for several reasons.\n     First, this kind of advertisement should be forbiden reasoning the fact young children are still strongly vulnerable. Kids around these age (2 to 5 years old) do not have a maturated critical sense and anything can easyly persuade them. For instance, when I was three years old I used to be captivated for all the toys which were presented on tv commercials just because the way they were exposed. One of them was \"the ultimate max steel\" which was about a hundred dollars.\n     Secondly, I am also opposed the allowance of this advertisement because the severely consequence it causes into the parents and child's relationships. It is common we see parents having issues with their kids in reason to this kind of commercial. Many parents have an unhealthy relationship, or even a wrecked relationship, with their kids. One example is what happened with/to my cousin Patricia when she had her first child called Sophia. One day sophia got really excited with an advertisement about barbie doll and she could not think about anything else than having this toy. Unfortunately, my cousin did not have enough money to buy it, but her daughter - a three years old kid- did not understand it and got angry with Patricia, do not speaking well with her for three weeks!\n    In conclusion, I am strongly favourable to this statement. Advertisement for young kids, not only until 5 but until 8 years old should be forbiden reasoning the kid's vulnerability and the risk to their parents' relationships with them.  In last case, if the advertisements were still exposed, It would be essential some educational politics come with them, valorizing and teaching kids on understanding their parents.",

I think the physical activity can give us more profit in our life. For example if You are active every day, you can keep your health in good condition.\nSport activity also make us feel more flexible and ready to force every day. In conclusion I think you should give up your music classes.\n\nRegards\nMikolaj",

But soon I made up my mind, thinking that I can’t be so decadent forever I want some change, hoping I will be better in the next year.  So I practiced it day and night.

We don't eat at home and it's very common eating junk food every week.\n\nOn the other hand, children are used to eat only what they want because in general they don't like legumes, vegetables, fruits, fish... They like eating junk food, hamburgers, French fries and sweets and what's more they don't do any exercise. All these reasons could be very bad for their health in the future. So it's very important to give them a healthy education.\n\nTo sum up,it is very important to be conscious about how food affect our health.

But I hope one day go to a tournament, travel to Spain and watch my favourite player who is Rafael Nadal from Spain. Since the first time I watched him play, eight years ago was the same year that I started watch Tennis. I like how the players moved through the court and how the audience applaused them every time they won a point, although I'm not in the court I could feel the feeling of the game, it's really awesome. Once in awhile I enjoyed watch Tennis when there was a competition or tournament, besides I watched and enjoyed it, also could learn how real the game was, which were its rules or what happened when they yelled at the jumpire for a no-reason, all these details you could learn and wait for a coming day to put them in practice or help to the players, is one of the things that I want to make real.\nMy advice would be that I you want to play Tennis just go ahead play it, not expect till others do it, because you can do that too. At the beginning it could be a little harsh, but is the same with many others sports when they start, so just keep in mind that you can play Tennis with the most talented players from the world overall.",

I couldn't agree with the point of view for some reasons below.\n\nFirstly,the growing number of private cars cause the big problem with traffic jam .People spend extra time on normal travel because of traffic jam.That wastes people's time and make people feel exhausted.Not mention to say,it's definitely hard to enjoy travelling in holidays.Secondly,private  cars are the main reason for the air pollution.We should consider the protection of environment for human future,not only care about the convenience we can see for now.\n\nIn the other hand, public transport system can reduce the amount of private cars in the busy area,like bus and tram . People can travel through the city easily and safely.For instance Melbourn,the secondary city in Australia where are trams via through the whole city area.Therefore people don't need to drive cars for travelling in the city.The last point is people go for long journey by public transport.Public transport bring relaxing holiday and efficient business trip to people without weary long drive.\n\nFor these reasons,it is unlikly there is no future for public transport.On the contrary,We need more public traffice to improve our traffic system and find the better way to maintain the environment.

I have confessed that in the first time I didn´t like it very much because I was a bit shy boy and I cost a lot of effort to integrate with the other players of the team but with the passage of the time I liked more and more.

We can discover new ways of travelling, take more care of our public transport and modernise them, so people would be motivated to travel by. \n\nMy trust in futuric technology is so enormous that I hope there are going to be a new ecological and cheaper ways to travelling around our world.

Firstly, start to use renewable energy. to illustrate, when we use the renewable energy we reduce emissions so,our natural resources will be conserved for our future furthermore sons future . for example,using wind Energy or Solar Energy for electricity generation we will be used less fuel what is affected in emissions. Secondly, we should improve our regulations that rules impose people lowering using things make a lot of pollution illustrate, using big vehicles or about building big facilities such as big factories. As a result, ways to cut down on pollution. for instance, when one person uses a car for 6 people and many people do the same that make a lot of pollution for that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future . All in all, using renewable energy and improve our regulation is two ways to cutting down pollution for a better future. \n\nAnother thing we can do to a better future is avoiding war. Because, war destroys mankind and countries . Many wars start because, people don't know or respect the other beliefs very well thus, we need to learn about belief other people we are live with them. for example, the fight between Muslim and Hindus in India or in Lebanese civil war. Secondly, do more cooperation between countries.To illustrate, people should cooperation To intervene to bring peace to the world to stop the war in many areas like what United Nations doing.For example, United Nations has taken the decision to ban mandatory weapons against South Africa because of racial persecution policy . in brief, knowing each other and do more cooperation between countries it is to ways to avoid war for a better future.\nfor that we need to improve our regulations to make people use small cars for cutting down on pollution for a better future .

There happened several serious natural or man-made disasters in this year. In Taiwan, a serious air crash caused by the bad weather happened first. A terrible explosion resulting from carelessness followed. A storm of food problems broke out next. In the global, up to three air crashes which result from being hijacked or shot happened. There were also conflicts between western countries and the ISIS.\n\tIn my opinions, all of us are supposed to be careful about all the details when we deal with everything to prevent disasters. Additionally, all human beings should stop fighting and devote ourselves to pursuing a peaceful world. Last but not least, we should do everything with our conscience.

  "text": "Running\nI am fond of running! Many people think running is a wasting time or it`s very difficult but I don`t agree. Firstly, you will be stronger, enduring. I started with three kilometers for one jog. Now my average jogging is 8-10 kilometers and going on 40-50 minutes. My best result is 15 km, but I guess awhile. Secondly, you will be healthier. I am less having a cold. Even if I have a cold, I will get out and will run 4-5 km. After that on the next day, I feel myself better. Four years ago I had often cold and recovery long period. Now I have more energy and health to become happier. Thirdly, you will be more confident. I started running four years ago. Cause of this was hurt my leg. After rehabilitation I continued feel hurt in my foot and I still limped. I decided to stop this and one gorgeous morning I starting running! As result, I know the men can be harder than can be seem. After these moments, you starting doing things that many people think impossible or even unbelievable.\nMy recommendations for beginners. \n1) Improve yourself in a gradual way.
