  "text": "People have had a need in communication since the dawn of time.Every human being has a need in socialising and that is the first reason why I believe we start making friends.\n Personally I usually get on with people pretty well and make new friends easily as I am a natural extrovert (or so I think). It usually starts with small talks or compliments, as at school I was taught that expressing appritiation to people can be a good start of any kind of relationships. A true friendship itself forms on a base of strong mutual understanding and this takes a good deal of time. Friends do not have to share the same opinion on every topic, however, they should respect and support each other even if they disagree.\nAll in all, even despite the fact that making friends can be a struggle (they need our time and efforts), they give us support and love and improve our mood when we need it most.

  "text": "I was walking in the center of Turin when I saw a big, beautiful hotel, with a lot of police who were trying to maintain law and order because there were a lot of people like me that wanted to know what was going on.\n\nI saw a policeman who was my friend and he explained to me that a man had been killed by someone and he allowed me to go into the room and see the scene of the crime.\n\nI went to see the room of this poor man, called Mr Smith. All the room was in order and the policeman explained to me that the man, who had been very old, had also been rich. Mr Smith was found on the floor with next to him a glass, which was completely broken.\n\nI thought that he must have called the reception for some wine, as the waitress said that every night after he had eaten, he always drank a glass of wine. \nAll night the body had lain like this on the floor. The next day the waitress knocked once, twice , three times but no one answered, so she thought that the man might have gone out. She opened the room with some keys that all the waitresses have, and saw Mr Smith lying dead on the floor. The detectives analysed what was in the glass and it was poison. \n\nI think that someone who wanted to inherit Mr Smith’s money must have killed him for this reason. In fact I discovered that Mr Smith's nephew wanted all his fortune. So he must have killed him with the poison. Sometimes people will do anything for some money\n",

First I completely agree with this but then when I started to think about it I realized that it's not like that. \n\n Firstly I think that if you work as a team  you can help each other and if you have more people to talk about any situation you could have a better and more completely answer because you have the ideas and the knowledge of every single member of the group.\n \nSecondly I think that the members of the team give you support, love and company. Sometimes the members of a group began to be so close to you that you love them the same as if they were part of your family. Moreover if it is a really nice group it is funnier to work with them than to work alone.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that it's better to work as a team than to work on your own because they give you love, company and you could pass a very good time",

Born in the 1970's as a military project to interconnect the missile facilities and the central headquarters, it soon spread to universities and educational centers. This fact, along with the spreading of personal computers, quickly became in a generalization of its use in the first decade of the XXI century.\nNobody wants to dismiss the importance of television and its achievements. For more than 50 years it has been the main entertainment channel displacing others as radio, theater, cinema and, sadly, also books.\nIn its first years television was also an important channel to culture (theater plays, classic films, etc.). Unfortunately, in the last years television has lost this educational focus.\nThe Internet, on the other side, has became more and more popular not only for entertainment but also for business and today is almost impossible to find an activity in which the Internet doesn't play a major role.\nThe Internet has also replaced television to watch films and TV shows, especially among young people who prefer to download and watch the videos instead of watching on the fixed schedule of TV.",

  "text": "Public transport has been discussed enough but there is always space for further discussion. Now the question uder discussion is whether public transport has future as travelling by car is gaining more and more popularity because of its advantages. Well, I think it has future. \n\nFirst, there are always lots of people who would prefer not to give much thought where to park their car or how to avoid traffic jams. The metro, which is a means of public transport, solves all these problems. In smaller towns without underground  there are usually a number of bus routs to cover the city area, so, all you need is to go to a bus stop and to get on a bus and soon you'll reach the destination. One shouldn't forget that using public transport helps to save money. It's not a secret that gas, insurance and reparings are costly. \n\nSafity issue is very important also. It is obvious that  is safer for the environment than thirthy cars with  an only person inside. You should take into account that thirty drivers(often inexperienced or aggressive) pose a greater danger to road users than  than one trained bus driver who feels responsibility for his passengers and for other participants of the traffic. The answer is evident, I think.\n\nAnd the last but not the least thing is that there are quite a lot of people who are not able or just don't want to drive, so the only way out for them is public transport. Moreover, cities' authorities encourage development of public transport because it creates employment, lessens impact on the environment and contributes to road safity.\n\nSo, my opinion is that public transport does have the future. Travelling by car is convenient but public transport has undeniable benefits for long lasting life as well.\n",

Someone would write something short and simple like \"Keep smiling\" or \"You're beautiful\" and leave the note on the mirror right behind the front door. No name of the author on it, but let's face it - there was only one guy on Brooklyn who would wake up every day before the dawn, no matter if it was raining or snowing, and run like crazy to Alison's family small flat. Just to make her smile every single morning as if something amazing had happened to her. \nOccasionally her older sister would watch her down from the hall and poke her index finger on her forehead. \"What a jerk\" she'd mutter under her breath. But truth was that she was jealous. Very, very jealous. \nThomas was one of those guys that every gal had wished to be around with. He was handsome as hell, well-build and a true gentleman. He worked hard at the docks to make a good living with his mother. She lost her job when war started, as well as her husband - Tom's father. Back then it was pretty obvious that regardless his young age of seventeen, he would quit school and start earning money. Because it's just the way Tom is - stubborn and righteous. \nAlison, well... Try to fit a heart and bravery of a lion into a small frame of sixteen-year-old girl. She was weak, but preferred to be called fragile, as if that made a significant difference. Her major health problem was asthma, as well as anemia, low immune system and underweight. Credits to the last one, she's skin and bones with almost no muscles. All her clothes are from kids section and yet they're usually too loose. But there's something in her big bright eyes, circled with long brown eyelashes and frecles, that makes her appearance unique and causes Tom's heart to flutter every time he brings to his mind her piercing stare. \nAlison's sister, on the other hand, is a total opposite. Mary is a picture of health with all her curves and pretty face. Small snub nose, full lips and high cheekbones. No freckles as her skin is perfect at every inch. The only thing they have in common are eyes, taken from their mother. Rest is anything but completely different.\nThat's why Mary is constantly surrounded with a bunch of fellas meanwhile Tom is the only one to follow Alison and have her back. And hell, she needs at least one to do it. \n",

  "text": "FILM REVIEW\nROMEO AND JULIET, Franco Zeffirelli (1968)\n\nThe best known love story of all time – Romeo and Juliet – has been adapted a number of times for the cinema and also made into successful musicals. One of the most renowned romance films based on the Shakespearean play was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in 1968. This flick  stands out from low quality versions because of its accurate details. The script is a faithful translation of the original text and the plot, as well, sticks to  Shakespeare’s work. \n\nThis remarkable story is set in Verona in the 15th century. The film, instead, was shot in central Italy and surprisingly the scene of the balcony hasn’t even been filmed in Verona. It’s about the tragic fate of two young lovers whose families are bitter enemies. Romeo and Juliet fall in love and secretly get married. The young bridegroom then is involved in a brawl and banished from the village. The play becomes tremendously thrilling until the couple’s death.\n\nThe acting of a classic is undoubtedly a difficult task, and yet Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting play their role very convincingly. Believable costumes and location, unforgettable soundtrack and outstanding performances celebrate a gripping and moving story that will charm you.\n\nIf you fancy travelling back in time, don’t miss this piece of art. It’s worth it!\n",

However the water is dirty and it is recommended to clean the pool at least twice a week.\n\nThe gym is nice and comfortable, but newer machines should be bought to replace some of the machines that are actually in use.\n\nThe new tennis court was found very useful because most members of the club claimed that they liked playing tennis.  Also the court is cheap and the changing room is nice and clean. On the other hand the opening hours are not enough and they should be extended.\n\nThe gym reception is nice, but the walls are painted with dark colours.

She began to reminisce about the start of her journey.\n\nBack then when she had been a little kid, she had dreamed of seeing the entire world. In order to realize her dream, she had begun her journey. It hadn't been easy, she had had to leave her beloved homeland behind.\n\nJust after saying farewell to her homeland, she had met an old woman. The woman had smiled to Alice and had given her some words of advice, \"Young girl you lose something important to you. But don't worry, as long as you're willing to regain it, no matter what it takes, you will find it again\". Alice had looked on confusion as the woman had been walking away.\n\nMany years had passed. Alice had gone through the entire world, from the hottest desert to the highest mountain. Alice had decided to return to her homeland. However, when she had arrived there hadn't been anything but a barren desert. She had been shocked. Her family and her homeland had disappeared. Sadness stroked her heart.\n\nBut, just as hope almost disappeared, she had remembered the words of the old lady. And so, she had looked around to find a way. Then she had found a gate nearby. As unbelievable as it seems, it had been a gate of time. It had been told that anyone who stepped through it would be cursed, but Alice's willingness had been stronger than her fears. She, without any hesitation, had gone through the gate.\n\nFinally, after much time travels, Alice had this feeling.The feeling of the end of her great journey through time. She went for her last journey.\n\nThe first thing she saw was a young girl. She looked at her and was instantly reminded. That girl, indeed was Alice herself in her youth. More specifically, it was Alice when she was starting her journey. She instantly knew that her homeland must be nearby.\n\nShe then said the same words as the old lady she had met long ago. And finally, she went on to her destination, her beloved homeland.\n\n\n\n\nHas you told me that I will win some literary competitions and that some people will speak well of me, I wouldn’t have believe you.\nThe year was 2012 and I hadn’t written anything until that day – I just had been translating some stories and once even subtitles for a Korean movie from English and Spanish. But that day – it was on spring and I believe it was Thursday – my English teacher told us about a literary competition. The theme was ‘I visited the Earth in2112’. It sounded like a quite good challenge for me so after finishing the then lessons I quickly sat down and started writing. And when I wrote down the last sentence I immediately sent it to the stated email. Only then I realised that there is nothing more to do, that I have to just wait. First days I was a little bit nervous but day by day I started forgetting about any competition.\nBut a month ago my mobile phone started to ring. An unknown number. I picked up and heard nice woman voice. And that voice told me that I am a winner of a third place! So happy was I!\nThat moment a bit changed my life because I’ve started to write more and more stories. And the more won competitions, the more proud was I of myself.\n",

  "text": "Since I was a child, I had been curious to know how stuff works. Disassembling games, building things of wood and playing Lego were my favorite hobbies. Through the years, my interest in machines and electrical devices increased, so whenever a device stops working I tries to fix it before calling the maintenance, and my parents always encouraged me even when I broke it down.\nWhen I was in secondary school, and my friends were dreaming of be Doctors or Dentists, I decided that I will be an electrical engineer or mechanical engineer, so I entered the scientific branch. During my study, my parents and I noticed that I understand kinetic physics more than electrical physics. Also, I was good at mathematics subjects that related to solid geometry, that is why I decided to study mechanical engineering.\nSince I enrolled in the faculty of mechanical engineering, I had a goal to complete my master study in Europe or America. After searching and asking, I found Germany has numerous prestigious technical universities, and it offers great study atmosphere for foreign students and supports them in many ways. Moreover, Germany is one of the biggest industrial countries in the world and it has many huge factories. Additionally, the living costs are quite affordable.\nFor those reasons, I am convinced that Germany is the best country to complete my study abroad.\nI have been working as a teacher of mechanical materials in a vocational school since my graduation. I really like this profession and how good it feels to spread science and knowledge to new generations. Therefore, I have decided that I am going to continue my postgraduate study and pursue a Ph.D. degree to work as a teacher at a university.\nI have been looking for a while for suitable university to apply to. I read about TU-Clausthal and I decided to apply to it for many reasons. First, I like the curriculum of the mechanical engineering master program. Second, TU-Clausthal has very good rating in engineering at many websites like ranking.zeit.de. Third, TU-Clausthal gives conditional admission and it has a language center. Finally, TU-Clausthal located in fascinating nature.\nI hope that I get the chance to complete my study at your university and to gain practical experience in one of the greatest industrial countries in the world.\n",

  "text": "A lot of different languages are spoken in all over the world, and it is not easy to choose one of them to learn it. my view is that nowadays English is an important language that it is necessary for almost everyone, so I will choose to learn  English first.\n\nThe most common reasons to study a language are the job and travelling. Although in some places people don`t speak English, you always can find somebody who does. \n\nIn addition, English is not too difficult to learn. Even though you have to study vocabulary and expressions, the grammar is easy to understand and you can be able to do simple sentences in a few days.\n\nOne of the subjects at school is English. Therefore, we have to study it, and when we finish school we usually continue improving our English before learning another one.\n\nAll things considered, I think that English is the easiest option when you want to study a language. Whereas there are a lot of options, we rarely start learning other language before we can communicate well in English.\n",

  "text": "Digital advertising; an exciting but undesirable business\n\n\nIt is indisputable that advertising has become a permanent fixture in our daily lives. Once a curious novelty that was largely considered a harmless addition to our sometimes dull and overly familiar environment, it was welcomed as fun and informative. It was also - if one wished to do so - relatively easy to ignore.  But we have now entered a new era of the attention-grabbing business: its digitalisation. \nTheir transformation from innocent posters to digital screens ranging in size from miniscule to vast has made adverts all-pervasive. Researchers say that an average adult in the developed world is now exposed to hundreds of commercial messages every day.\n\nThose involved in this lucrative business are in awe of the almost endless possibilities that recent technological advances offer them. Multimedia, advertising and entertainment companies now work in synergy to target everyone from toddlers who can barely speak to pensioners confused with the speed of life in the new age, unsubtly playing on their needs and desires in order to turn them all into faithful consumers. \nThey have so successfully infiltrated their own product into our everyday existence that we no longer see it anymore as what it really is: a nuisance. Creators of adverts have long given up on informing the consumers and instead opted for seducing them. The result are insincere, misleading and often deceitful messages that our minds are saturated with.\n\nPerhaps it is time to do an experiment and hit a pause button and reflect upon this subject matter.  Imagine a world without adverts, for a week at least. Would it be bleak and boring and leave us at a loss as what to buy, or might it just turn out to be a long yearned for respite?\n",

  "text": "Dear Chairman,\n\nI am writing with regard to the campaign that you are promoting in favour of an international sports competition that could be hosted in my town.\n\nAs a matter of fact Venice could be a very good candidate for hosting the marathon competition, which will last one day\n\nMoreover Venice is one of the most beautiful cultural cities in Italy. The marathonetscoming before or staying after the competition can take the advantage of visiting the city, which offers a great deal of facilities\n\nThere are two separate communication networks in the city, that of the waterways and that of the narrow streets. Public water buses and private water taxis run 24 hours a day although less frequently at night. The main centre can be reached very easily. Despite the private service is very expensive it is efficient.\n\nFour and five stars hotels are located in the main area, but smaller hotels and a youth hostel are also available to families.\n\nHotel receptions and travel agencies are always ready to help their guests with a wide range of information on the city's entertainments, exhibitions and so on.\n\nSightseeing and excursions with private local guides are available on request.\n\nIn addition to this there is a significant lack of evening entertainments in the city such as theatres, cinemas and night-clubs.\n\nOn the contrary participants will find a wide range of restaurants, trattorias and bars with a good selection of menus suggesting local food.Some of these restaurants can be quite expensive.\n\nIn conclusion I think there will be no obstacles and objections to host this sporting competition in my town which on the other hand is also a cultural event for many of the participants.\n\nYours faithfully",

I helped catering the staff and during the concert I was free to walk around wherever I wanted because they gave me a security badge. I just had to make sure nobody was hungry or thirsty. This also meant I was allowed to go backstage and take care of the bands. I had asked if I had permission to stand in front of the stage during the main concert and the organisation agreed. The support act was a rather unknown band but they were really good. Did I tell you who the headliner was? I don't think so.. It was NICKELBACK ! Their setlist was extremely good. They played all of their famous songs and added some new ones. After the show I had the chance to meet the band members. Chad Kroeger gave me their new CD and the entire band signed it for me. The guys were really nice!\n\nI had an amazing time, too bad you couldn't be there.\n\nHope to see you soon.\n\nValerie",

  "text": "Hello Jane!\n\nHere is a picture from the last summer when we were in Halland on an island called Nidingen!\n\nMy name is Lorin and I am 13 years old. I live in Djursholm at Riddarvägen 42, close to a field. I was born on August 4 at the hospital in Danderyd. In my family we are five people, my mom Malak, my dad Claes, my little sister Novalie and my little brother Edvard. Novalie is 10 years old and Edvard is 6 years old. In my spare time I like to be with friends and I do also play soccer, dance and ski. I really like to do sports because I like to be outside. I compete in skiing and I think it's very funny. I often go skiing in Åre, Vemdalen and in Ramundberget. Once every year I ski with my ski club (Täby slalomklubb) in Switzerland. In Switzerland we have been to Saas fee and Zermatt. In Zermatt you can see the mountain Matterhorn (the mountain that you see on toblerone package). It is a very cool mountain. I do also ski with my family and that is the best. I like slalom because it goes fast and I like snow. In the summer holidays my family and I just to be at the vest seaside on a small island called Kålhuvudet. That is one of our summerhouses I love to be there because when we are there we swim in the ocean and we fish crabs and just have a really fun. You can of course see the ocean and it is very beautiful.\n\nSomething else I like to do is shopping. My parents call me a shopaholic and I almost agree. I like it because it is fun to look at clothes and try them.\n\nI read pretty much and my favourite book is Harry Potter. I like fantasy and that book is fantastic. If it was possible to go on Hogwarts I would do it. Now you know what my favourite book is so you can almost guess what my favorite movie is… Of course Harry Potter. But I do also like a movie called The game plan. It is about an American football player who doesn't know that he has a daughter and one day the daughter came to his apartment. Then it is a fun and fantastic story that I don’t want to say  because then it is not going to be fun to see the movie. I don't see movies only I look at some series to. For example Pretty little liars and Modern Family. Pretty little liars is a little bit scary but I like it. Modern family is my favourite series. I like it because it is very comic.\n\nMy favourite song is a song called Chandelier with an artist called Sia. It is a girl called Jasmine Thompson and she sing cover songs and I think she is a really good singer. I do also like a song called classic with an artist called MKTO. One band I like is One direction I think they sing really good. When they were in Sweden I was on their concert and after that my voice were almost gone. But there was really fun to be there but is what pretty cold, because on friends arena the roof was open.\n\nMy favourite food is sushi or a fillet of beef with potatoes and béarnaise. I like sushi because the combination with fish, rice and soya makes it delicious. I like beef and my favourite is a fillet of beef with béarnaise, it is a very good combination. My favourite restaurant is a restaurant called dahlboms in Åre because they have the best spaghetti bolognese ever. \n\nHope you enjoyed your reading, I think this is what you maybe want to know about me!\n",

Local people were invited and a talent competiton was held. Several student bands played and a variety of food was available!\n\nEverything started on Saturday afternoon on the main square in Krakow. Number of people exceeded my expectations! There were a lot of them. The weather was fantastic: the sun was shining and birds were singing. Generally, bands played great, but of course there were also terrible singers in the competition - but it didn't matter so much. I'll never forget the sounds and smiles of these happy people with their arms in the air who were standing under the stage.\n\nAs we know, this type of event can't take place without food. On a Charity Fun Day the air was filled with the fabulous smells of Indian, Italian and many other world cuisine. \n\nUnfortunately, not all of the food was tasty, so one of the thing I'd suggest changing next year is to avoid the hot dogs. Also I'd recommend delicious homemade ice cream.\n\nIt was fantastic experience, especially for people for which it was intended.

  "text": "I discovered the English language when I was eight, and that amazed me so much that one year later I started to take a course. English was also the key for my passion for technology, the more that I understood the language, the more I understood how to use computers and the internet. About six months later, I joined a computer class for kids in the same location that I took the English classes and since then, my love for computers and the language just grew.\n\nThat is why I wish to work in the areas of Computer Sciences, and studying abroad would give me an extra motivation and open new doors to show and expand my full potential. Besides being my personal favorite for its culture and language, the United States of America offers big opportunities in this area, for it's great universities and educational system.\n\nI am currently an intern on a scientific research program in a group called GALP - Logical Programming Teaching Group, that, with the local city hall of Araraquara, aims to transform the city into a national  technology, research and software producing center, accomplishing this goal by teaching logical thinking and alghoritms to kids, diminishing future evasion in many exact sciences courses. To bring back from this exchange technical knowledge in programming, as well as new methods of teaching, would be outstanding.\n\nAlthough I write and speak English in an advanced proficiency level, this exchange would provide the fluency I need in academic grounds and interpersonal communication, as all of the most relevant  papers, research and journals are written in English, I want to achieve this level to make it easier to write and produce good material for the scientific community, and to communicate better with all cultures.\n\nIn Brazil, there is a huge lack of professionals on the field of information technology in both academic and work market, travelling abroad, especially in the U.S., would qualify me in both areas. Although I prefer the academic field, working in a company related to software design and creation would be a marvellous way of gaining experience in the field.\n\nI would be happy too, if by any chance I could apply to summer jobs or internships, as another way of gaining experience. Working as an intern at an information technology company or as a teacher assistant would provide me with a good example of how the market work for both academic and work careers.\n \nIn conclusion, I want to study in the U.S. for it's differentiated educational system, for the work and research opportunities that I might find, to know better a culture that amazes me for its capacity to innovate in all fields,to become fluent in a language that I love, to return to my country with more knowledge in areas that I would not find here, and, in long - term, become a better professional or teacher, with a good and solid background on computer sciences, information technology and finally, system analysis and development.\n",

  "text": "\"Installation art\" is a new form of expression made of a mixture of media art works, used by contemporary artists to communicate something in a modern way, different from traditional arts. Installations are usually placed in big spaces because they have an important structure with the main task of making people reflect on something important that the artist needs to communicate to the biggest number of people.\n\nPersonally, I have seen only one \"installation art\". It was situated into a stand in Parque Del Retiro, in Madrid. It was built by two different elements. The first, placed in a corner of the stand, was made by a pile of plastic bottles and plastic baskets. The second, in the centre of the stand, was a column made of coloured plastic baskets, surrounded by plastic bottles. The artist wanted to represent the difference between the ecological recycling of plastic compared to the common collection of trash. Seeing it for the first time it was impossible to understand the meaning of the column or the pile. Only after having read the explanation it was possible to appreciate the installation art, and to have the complete attention to its meaning and shape.\n\nDespite their beauty, new form of arts are very complicated to understand, especially compared to classical arts. An example could be the medieval art. Seeing a Da Vinci's portrait or a landscape painting, it is immediately possible to appreciate the beauty of colours or the accuracy of shapes and the expressions of the subjects painted. At first sight those paintings evoke an emotion in the observer, and the name of the piece helps  to have a complete knowledge of the masterpiece. On the other hand, looking at an installation art it is harder to have a clear emotion at the first sight without knowing the meaning of it or something about the artist.\n\nIn conclusion I think that all forms of art are made for the same reason, to communicate something. In every historic period, artists have represented their life and what they feel in different ways. Classical art was more easy for us to understand because it has been studied at school and it is very famous, while modern arts are totally new and more complicated to understand because of their composition and their significance. In my opinion the difference between installation arts and classical arts stands in the feeling that they can suscitate in the audience.\n",

I have experience in looking after children. I am always willing to help in anything. I can be very creative when in comes to fun things. I took cooking classes last year, so I can also work in the kitchens.\n\nI think it is very important for children to have fun in the summer camps.

A feeling of being completely free, a joy of moving on a surface of water standing on a small board, an incredible speed - all of those things can easily make you happy.\nWhen I tried kitesurfing by myself for the first time, I was a little bit scared. \"How difficult it is!\" - that was my very first thought while seeing some surfers on the Baltic sea in Poland. But believe me - there's nothing to worry about! Despite the fact that it seems hard, kitesurfing is one of the easiest water sports! If you just learn how to keep a control of your body standing on a surfboard and how to steer a kite, there's nothing that seems hard any more.\nMy only advice is: go to the seaside, find a nice camp for surfers with a good instructor, and enjoy your moments of freedom!",

It was a dream come true. She's my favourite singer. Although I was a cleaner, it was the best thing, that recently happened to me. Before the concert I had to sweep up the whole hall. During the concert I was responsible for supervision of sort-out in toiletes. It wasn't my dreamy job, but it really repayed. After the concert I saw Adele and my friend took a picture of me with her! Can you imagine that? She smiled to me! I wish I could do it again. By the way, I met there your exgirlfriend with her new boyfriend. Of course, I told her, you're dating Lisa now. Apart from that, I'm going to help at Coldplay's concert in two months. I hope, it won't be my last job at concert.\nAnyway, I must go now. I can’t wait to hear from you. Tell me everything about your new girlfriend.\nWrite soon.\n\nLots of love,\nAla.\n",

  "text": "This past year was special for me, I graduated from High School and I took a gap-year. It was a very confusing but probably the best year of my life and I will tell you why.\n\nAs I said earlier, I graduated from High School which was a huge relief. It was aweful. The students were mean and the teachers didn't like me at all. So on the day the vacation started I was the happiest I've ever been. \n\nThus came the question of what I was going to do next, but I wasn't ready to make that descission back then so with agreement of my parents I decided to take a gap-year. Which was the best thing that ever happened to me. \n\nI was extremely nervous about a week before my departure. I was going to spend the next 6 months in the United States which actually teriffied me. As my departure came closer, I started to question myself more and more if this was a good idea and if I would have a good time all those things. On the big day I must say that I kind of felt numb, I didn't know what to think and what to feel. \n\nThe journey to the United States was surprisingly good,  I had some friends on the plan who were going to the same destination as me and I actually didn't miss my family that much. \nThe 6 months I send there were the best of my life, I was so happy and enjoyed myself every day.\n\n I also got to know myself better and I have reached a descission of what I want to do next year, I am going to study at the university. I hope that I will enjoy that as much as I enjoyed this past year, it was truly amazing.\n\nSo if you are ever even considering the fact of taking a gap-year, don't doubt, just do it. It is amazing!",

I was sure that I hadn’t left the window open. So who had…? \n\nI was wondering that maybe it’s just my imagination. I had been staying at home for five days, I wasn’t really willing to see other people. Maybe I have gone mad? I stared blankly at the window, unable to move. Eventually, I slowly opened the door and came out of my room. I went to the kitchen and sit on the chair, nervously fiddling with my bracelet. It suddenly broke apart, and all the beads dropped on the floor. In that sinister silence, it seemed to be the loudest sound on the world. \n\nAll of sudden, my phone rang. It was my best friend. „Laura? Are you okay? We haven’t talked for ages”, she said. It was reassuring to hear a familiar voice. I had been feeling so lonely for a long time. Before I made it to tell something, I heard terrible scream and my friend just hung up. I felt cold sweat again, just like five minutes ago when I’d seen open window.\n\nAfter a little while, I heard a hoarse voice coming from the room with the open window. „Laura? Come here. We havent’t talked for ages”. It was my best friend’s voice. ",

We also see that people adhere to the norms when they build new houses and don't encroach on any public lands. We encourage people commuting to nearby places to walk or use a bicycle depending on the distance and those going to the same areas outside the town to join car pools. We also have a biogas plant in our outskirts that takes care of the rubbish and sewage and the power generated is used for street-lights and meeting the power needs of the community office. We distribute jute bags annually with our community logo on it so that people can use them instead of plastic bags. Each year, we encourage school-going children to plant trees to teach them the importance of trees in safeguarding our environment so that they can grow up to be responsible towards the environment. We encourage people who come up with any innovative thoughts about how we could further protect the environment. Besides this, we often visit our neighbouring towns and educate them on the issues of global warming, the threat to ecological balance etc., and guide them on how to protect our environment.",

One of the biggest disadvantages of being popular is that they are on everybody's lips. Public loves to know everything about their idols and they always try to find out some spicy details.\nEveryone deserves privacy, but public figures should be aware of the fact that the society wants to know about them as much as it's possible. Whether they like it or not, they should be prepared for photographers and journalists trying to chase them in every single moment of their life. It might be hard, but they need to be patient and try not to care about the people who interferes with their personal being.\nIn my opinion, journalists and paparazzi shouldn't stalk celebrities on their private holiday or try to get into their intimate life. There are some borders that shouldn't be crossed. For example, when a popular film star goes to hospital because of his relative's illness, reporters and photographers in particular should stay away and leave the celebrity alone.\nEven though they are well known, they have a right to have a free time and they should be albe to use it however they want to without anyone disturbing them. It's really important for people to know the bound between curiosity and nosiness. We should respect other's right to privacy and let them live their own lives.\n",

  "text": "Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing in response to the article about friendship that was published in your magazine. I would like to share my feelings about a particular friendship that is highly important to me and furthermore evaluate the reasons why is especially complicated to maintain long lasting friendships in any situation. \n\nFirst of all, as far as special friendships are concerned, I must say that I am not a person who makes friends easily, consequently I do not have a large circle of friends. However, I can portray a unique relationship that I have with a generous and warmhearted person. Although it is true that this is not a long term friendship I can admit that I have found a true friend. Throughout this friendship I have been given the support, the affection and the confidence to pursue my dreams. On the other hand, friendship is a two way street where you receive and give back the same favors and, naturally, I enjoy doing so. I value this friendship and is of great importance to me because it is a balanced one of a kind relationship. \n\nSecondly, I would like to say that maintaining friendships over time entails strenuous effort. A justification for this may be the fact that over the years people change and grow apart. For this reason not all childhood friends grow older as close confidants, simply because they are not the same people as they were before. As you gradually grow up your world expands, your personality changes and so do your acquaintances. However, the natural process of aging is not the only change we undergo but there are others such as enrolling in school, getting our first job or changing the old one, travelling or moving to another city. All this situations may impede us to stay in touch with old friends but on the other hand can give us the opportunity to make new ones. \n\nTo summarize, I would like to say that even thought we are incapable to remain on friendly terms with everyone we should know that the process of socializing is one of the factors what makes us human and we should always embrace it. \n\nYours faithfully,\nAllison Green\n",

  "text": "Viña del Mar is a wonderful city on the west coast of Central Chile and boasts a  number of shopping facilities and different sorts of attractions for tourists of all ages.\n\nThere are several shopping centres in different areas of the city. The biggest and best one is the Marina Arauco Shopping Centre, located on 15 Norte St. It has two anchor department stores, Almacenes Paris and Almacenes Ripley, one at each end of the  mall which is two blocks long. There are four floors, each of which contains different departments of the anchor stores, and a number of small shops which sell a variety of products. There is also a food court on the third floor, catering to all sorts of customers, as well as a few restaruants on the first and second floors. On the top floor there is a multi-cinema complex, offering several options of the latest movies. There are two underground floors for parking, which can get a bit crowded at peak seasons, but which are very reasonably priced.Nearby there is also a large supermarket and a home store which offers products for building purposes, also connected to a shopping gallery.\n\nAnother shopping option is the main streeet in the centre of Viña del Mar, which used to be more popular in the past, but which was displaced by the shopping centres. This street runs from the Viña Square towards the sea for about six or seven blocks, and has many small shops and businesses which attract a lot of people. There is a parking meter system, which is not very cheap, compared to the shopping mall parking, and it can be difficult to find parking nearby. There are several supermarkets and two anchor shops at one end of the street, which are convenient shopping venues for people who live in the city centre.\n\nThere are also other areas in Viña del Mar where groups of shops have concentrated so as to offer facilities to residential areas, also convenient for people who live in the surroundings.\n\nAll in all, I consider there is a wide variety of shopping options in our home town, so I expect tourists would not be disappointed with what there is to offer.",

Some information about what people do with their rubbish and how they try to keep the area clean, is described in the following lines.\n\nWhat do people do with their rubbish?\nAlthough the majority of the citizens in Zaragoza don't give a special treatment to their rubbish, there are some people who have recycle bins in their homes. Also, Zaragoza is provided with a number of collection points, where rubbish with big dimensions such as furniture can be collected and recycled.\n\nHow do the town try to keep the area clean:\nThere is a law which states that if someone throws rubbish such as papers, cigarettes or chewing gum to the street, they may be punished with a fine which could increase up to $100. We also count on the following services:\n1. A team of professional cleaners responsible for keeping the streets clean, scheduled every four hours and divided by areas.\n2. A commercial team responsible for raise awareness of the critical situation the environment is suffering.\n3. More than 200 buses with the aim to avoid excessive CO2 emissions.\n\nConclusion:\nZaragoza's population is aware of the importance of keeping the town clean and so they're willing to do plenty of things to avoid the pollution and its environmental consequences.",

As someone who hasn’t sung classical before and has no background in Hindi Singing, I found it very confronting to sing at a concert after only four months of training. However Narwal Ji has taught me from the basics of Indian singing, to being someone able to sing on stage in front of a large audience. He had given me a great opportunity to grow as a beginner singer to sing during a concert and his guidance as a teacher is something that I will always appreciate. He has given me a large amount of motivation, which led me to come all the way from Canberra to Melbourne to perform in this concert. The night had been a rewarding experience and boosted my confidence a greatly. In addition to this, the night was beautifully organised and each performance was professionally executed. An original mix of cultures were represented consistently. Overall the entire night was shown nicely and was entertaining for everyone watching. There was no time left to be bored!",

We have brainstormed about many possibly interesting locations, and we eventually decided to prepare a little tour at and around the Grand Place of Brussels. Away from busy and noisy roads, the beautiful old inner city reflects what Brussels really was for centuries; small but cosy cobblestone streets flanked by small houess and shops in light colours and old-fashioned roofs. In our opinion, the area around the Grand Place is the most beautiful part of the centre of Brussels and what really attracts so many visitors worldwide each year. We would gladly share our excitement about the Grand Place with your students so that they can immediately get acquainted with it as a very enjoyable place to go to.\n\nWe hope to receive a positive answer soon, and again, I thank you for your time and interest.\n\nSincerely,",

  "text": "Hi Mark,\n\nas you already know, I'm from a little town, Kętrzyn. Most of the year I live in Poznań, because of my studies at the University, but every summer I go back home to spend some time with my family and friends. Last summer I decided to do something more than just relax and have fun, so I started to look for an interesting summer job. Like I previously said, Kętrzyn is a rather small town, so there is only one old movie theatre and it's closed for most the time. It opens only in a time of summer, mainly for tourists. Because of that, there are no regular employees, at the beginning of every summer new season stuff is hired. So I decided to give it a try and I applied for that job. \n\nIt was the best summer ever. You know how much I love watching movies, especially in small and cosy movie theatres. It was like working in a paradise. My duties were pretty simple. Selling tickets, snacks and drinks, cleaning the place after and before the shows, so work itself wasn't the exciting part. The main reason why I loved to work there and every day I went to work with a big smile on my face were the possibilities to watch every show I wanted. There is only one auditorium so I was busy just between the shows and sometimes, for family shows, there was a 15 minutes break in the middle of the show, for the kids to use the toilet or buy more snacks and drinks. I watched almost every shown movie, some of them for more than once. When my work there came to an end, I was happy, but on the other hand, I felt some kind of sadness too. I mean, it was September, so I had a one whole month of vacation ahead of me to do whatever I wanted to and it was awesome because I could finally just relax, sleep, read books and spend a lot of time with my loved ones. On the other hand, I was sad to leave that job. This place really stole my heart and I miss its atmosphere, regular visitors and people I worked with. I'm planning to work there for the next summer too. \n\nAs you can see, my summer was great. How about yours? I remember you were saying something about planning to go to India. How was the trip? I bet it is an interesting story.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you,\nMaciej",

She highly recommends your school to Tsz Huan and us.  And she has written a letter to you asking for granting Tsz Huan an opportunity to grow up in the family of St Paul’s.\n\nIt goes without saying, we would like to provide the best we can for the development of our children – Tsz Yin and Tsz Huan.  To share and learn child-rearing tips with other parents, my wife joins the SPCC monthly book club.  To enhance our parent-child relationship and facilities our understanding of her school and social life, we participate in kindergarten's volunteer group.  In addition, we spend at least 3 hours together with Tsz Huan every day - reading, talking, painting and playing games.  We regularly go to parks, libraries, museums, visit the countryside together, and occasionally go on family holidays overseas.\n\nTsz Huan is a lively, cheerful and curious girl.  She enjoys reading, performing arts including painting, dancing, music and sports, swimming in particular.  Her teachers complimented her as being focused, creative and eager to learn. \n\nAs parents of Tsz Huan, we are keen to work with the school and be part of their development.  Tsz Yin very much cherishes her experience at St. Paul’s and we sincerely hope that Tsz Huan can have the opportunity to benefit from the quality education your school provides.\n\nThank you for your kind consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n",

However, the quantity of fish and chips plates eaten per year declined from 100 times per year in 1975 to just over 80 times in 1980. Then, there was a slight increase to about 95 times per year in 1985. After that, this trend kept falling and reached the lowest point in 2000 (just under 40 times that year).\nIn contrast, the consumption of hamburgers and pizzas started at about 10 times for hamburgers and 5 times for pizzas in 1975, and then rose constantly until it reached approximately 100 times and 85 times respectively in 1995.

My free time only allows me to work at weekends, which is why your place is perfect for me, and I also love the food there and people are always nice. The place is very near where I live, and I've worked in a lot of Cafes before, unfortunately I had to leave them for school and college. I know how to deal with people, I'm very sociable and would try my best to be the nicest person alive.\nWork in the Cafe will also allow me to meet people from the neighborhood, which is very important for me right now, since I just moved in. Sometimes I don't have time for myself to have fun, and for what I can see from your place, it is very popular and full of fun people.\nI can show all my recommendation letters from my previous jobs, but I'll say right now that they all say good things about me. I don't want to look like a jerk, that's not it. I really work hard. I take my jobs seriously and try my best to never let my bosses down. I try to never let my personal problems interfere in my professional life, and if it does some day, I would ask you to tell me, so I can change. I think you will like me. I'm very eclectic, but also fierce where I should be. I always have respect for my bosses and, of course, clients.\nI really want this. It would mean so much to me.    \nI'm totally free at weekends, so I can work long hours, plus I live very near and could help in some emergency if you need someday. I will never miss a day, unless it is very important, you can be sure of that. I may not know how to cook the usual food from the cafe, but I am a fast learner. I will only need one day to get used to the food and learn how to practise at home, and then it's up to me find a way to be good at it. I'll take my time to practise everything I can at home. I won't be much problem for anyone.\nI could say that I am a funny person, but that would be a lie. I'm not. My father said one day that, as a humorist, I'm a very good singer, and I don't even sing. I'll be nice, though. I'll make them love me.\nI hope you can give me a chance to show how much I want this job.\nYours, Geédes.",

  "text": "Set in in the late 1950s France, Chocolat deals with the topic of society discriminating against different people because of their being different: whether they are gypsies, women that don’t depend on men, or people that don’t share the Christian faith. The plot revolves around Vianne Rocher, a single mother and chocolate expert, opening a ‘chocolaterie’ right before Lent in a small, close-minded French village, the mayor of which decides to boycott her. During Lent, the protagonist gets to know other outcasts (mainly women) and help them. However, Vianne must learn to solve her own problems and change the course of her own life.\n\nOne of the strengths of the film is its star-studded cast: Juliette Binoche as Vianne, Alfred Molina as the mayor, Judi Dench as a grumpy, elder woman resented with the oppressing society of the village, and a young Johnny Depp as a handsome gypsy arriving in town with his caravan. Each and every one of the roles is beautifully written and the actors don’t fail in bringing them to life. Besides the cast, I would like to highlight the original soundtrack. It adapts perfectly to the theme of the movie, with a little bit of jazz manouche, a popular genre amongst European gypsy communities, and reminiscences of Mexican folklore, as the recipes Vianne Rocher prepares in the ‘chocolaterie’ are a heritage from her Maya ancestors.\n\nIf I had to find a down side to Chocolat, it would be that the film format does not allow us to have a deeper look into some of the characters and their storylines. Had it not been written in the year 2000, but today, I am sure that this story would have been turned into a successful TV series in which we could have learnt more about the past and the future of those fantastic characters.\n\nAll in all, this is a gripping, moving, and entertaining film that will make you reflect on some social issues. A must-see if, like me, you enjoy cinema with strong female characters on the lead roles, but you do not necessarily want to watch another dramatic story.\n",

  "text": "Travelling has become a great part of our daily lives, whether we only go to the nearby grocery store or choose to visit our relatives who live in another country. Modern means of transport are constantly improving, being faster and more comfortable than ever before. However, it is a wise decision to choose carefully between public and personal transport, because they have both advantages and disadvantages depending on where we want to travel.\n\nOn the one hand, personal cars are great because they allow people to travel whenever they want. This means they are able to have a flexible schedule. Another advantage of cars is the fact that they are family friendly, meaning that people who use them don't have to worry about travelling with strangers who might be dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, cars are not only expensive to purchase, they also require fuel, which is very expensive. Sometimes it is cheaper to use public transport such as busses, trains or airplanes, depending on the distance. Travelling across the Atlatic Ocean for example requires an airplane or a ship. Trains are a great way of transport across intercontinental distances, especially since they have become faster. Statistically speaking, car accidents are much more frequent than plane crashes or train accidents, so public transport is not only cheaper sometimes, but it's also safer and faster.\n\nAll in all, I believe that public transport will not disappear too soon.

You walk among ancient, fallen tombs shaded by high trees of great age.\nThen, you really must visit the synagogues: The Temple Synagogue, Isaac Synagogue, The Tall Synagogue and Remuh Synagogue. The synagogue is still being used as a place of prayer for the few remaining Jewish people in Cracow or for visitors from Israel or other parts of the world.\nFor the history lovers, I recommend going to the Historical Museum of The History and Culture of Jewish People. It is the oldest synagogue in Poland and was constructed in the XV century. Inside there is an impressive number of handicrafts, graphics and paintings.\nFinally, you can do shopping on The New Square, a round trading hall. You can buy there almost everything: fresh fruits, vegetables, and household products. On Sundays, the gamut of products is much more bigger. If you are a good browser you may find some original souvenirs of Cracow to take home with you.\nI think the Kazimierz is one of the most beautiful places in Poland. It’s appealing and full of this eerie spirit of the past. That’s why you must see it!\n",

  "text": "Parents face with important decisions when raising children, not the least of which is whether or not they should allow their children to keep a pet. Some parents would grasp in horror and reject it when their child asks them if he can keep a pet with him, whereas other parents would be more than happy to let their children have a pet. In my view, I believe that children should have pets because they can benefit from taking care of pets, especially in terms of their personality development.\n\nSpecifically, they learn to take responsibility when taking care of pets. Take my cat, Luka, for example, I found it on the streets and felt like keeping it with me when I was 12 years old. My mother told me that you would have to take care of it by yourself when I went to ask her if I could keep the cat. Since that day, I started to take care of on my own. I took it to the hospital when it was sick, and bought it food when it needed to be fed. I have therefore fostered a sense of responsibility since then. So, according to my personal experiences, I think that children can benefit from keeping a pet.\n\nSome people might argue that it is always parents who take care of the pets most of the time, instead of children themselves. Namely, parents always do things for children, such as housework, homework, even taking care of the pets for their children. Nevertheless, what those people have claimed is a digression from the topic here. This does not suggest that children cannot learn from having a pet with them. Why children cannot learn is because of their parents, not because of the pets. In other words, taking care of pets is absolutely beneficial to children so long as they are given an opportunity.\n\nMoreover, children can also learn to sympathize with others by keeping a pet, apart from leaning to be responsible. For instance, when Luka died when I was 20 years old, I was so sad and heart-broken as if one member was lost in our family. After that day, I started to be able to sympathize with people who have lost their beloved ones because I have been through a similar situation. Thus, keeping pets does enable people to be able to put themselves in others’ shoes.\n\nGiven upon my personal experiences, by taking care pets, children not only can learn to take responsibility, but also can learn to sympathize with others. In other words, keeping pets is beneficial to children in terms of their personality development. On the other hand, if children are not allowed to keep a pet, the parents will have to come up with other ways to make the children both responsible and sympathetic.\n",

With this belief, we endeavor to keep our city as clean and attractive as possible. Here, we are proud to report our accomplishments thus far.\n\nWe stick to the principle of 3Rs, namely reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\nReducing waste at source is always our top priority and education is of utmost importance in this regard. Nothing is more difficult than changing one's mindset given people's inertia. Hence, we have incorporated the concept of environmental protection into our curriculum so that students can develop an awareness of the matter at a young age. Different activities, including  seminars and exhibitions have been held in different districts to spread the message of environmental conservation across the community. \n\n\nRecycling bins have been installed in every public housing estate and most housing estates, along with the road-side ones found in every district. Public Housing Estate Recycle Competitions have also been held every year to promote the concept of recycling plastic, paper or tin and to help the residents cultivate such a habit in daily life. We are glad that our work has started to bear fruits in recent years. We have seen a great drop in the number of solid waste. \n\nApart from keeping our city clean by reducing waste, we also dedicate ourselves to building a green city. Tree planting campaign is carried out every year in cooperation with schools, community centres, etc. Eco-tour is also promoted to educate the public and tourists to appreciate the beauty of nature and, above all, to arouse their awareness and cultivate a caring heart towards nature.\n\nWith concerted efforts, we have made a great stride in environmental protection in recent years as seen in the declining number of waste and increasing number of greenery. We believe we will continue to make progress and make our home a better place to live in. ",

Besides, cycling along a canal allows me to witness flowers and trees blossoming and fowls' chicks growing up, reminding me of the beauty of nature. \nHowever I believe that it is at home that I contribute most to saving natural resources; we are, obviously, very careful with turning off the taps as we wash our hands, brush our teeth and so on, and we recycle as much as possible. Yet, our most rewarding action  has been starting a compost. We feed worms our food and organic waste, which has drastically decreased it. Moreover, we now use the compost for our garden patch and cacti. Another good point: we have converted our next door neighbour! \nComposting has made us more aware of our waste and the amount of packaging in the items we buy. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone, whether they live in a flat or in a house with a garden.",

  "text": "  Shopping is not always enjoyable. We live in the mass consumption century, when it requires more and more time of our daily routines. For some this activity is a torture, for others it is the most pleasurable way of spending free time. But have you ever gone to the shop just for milk and bread and came back with a full bag of goods but no bread ?\n  First of all, shopping is unavoidable  as it is necessary to shop for food. It depends on a person how often he goes to grocery, probably according to individual needs. Most of consumers do not count time spent in food stores, as they have their own habits and their attitudes towards shopping. Some people choose bigger supermarkets as they offer greater variety of goods, but require more time, while others just pop into the closest store and do their shop weekly. If you have a already made  shopping list, it saves your time and energy, so that you do not need to wander between rows in grocery store. When it comes to parties it is even more time consuming and irksome, than the ordinary one. Moreover, the most annoying is the last stage of buying goods - waiting in queues in order to pay. The queue you are standing in seems to be always the longest. Secondly, shopping in supermarkets is extremely irritating before annual celebrations, or during seasonal sales. Hundreds gather there, parking spaces are full, again facing longest queues in stores - how much unpleasant is souds, it is the reality of nowadays. People become crazy, nervous or dull while shopping. Afterwards some get into their cars and get stuck in traffic jams on the way home, it causes more tension and disimproves mood! Also,some people spend huge sums of money on things that are not essential, they are attracted by commercials, advertisements, sales assistant recommendations, so they do not follow their budgets by buying everything, as they are excited by the shopping process itself,it causes regrets and financial problems afterwards. Finally, it may be very fatigue, as you may waste the precious time just by walking around but not finding the thing are interested in and need. Then you feel tired and depressed about the idea of keep looking for it in another place. On the other hand, the majority feel lazy and they go shopping just for special occasions, without any rush, they dedicate time in search of fashionable clothes, best quality garmets, stylish items. It comes as no surprise that women love shopping. \n  Although, shopping may be entertaining, it is still a time consuming and tiresome job. Being busy and spending time looking for clothes, presents, souvenirs, furniture or healthcare products especially for women may be a perfect way of spending even all day. On the other hand, searching for your favourite brands, non-seasonal products, some special goods, just looking through shelves, trying the garmets on you, asking for consultations, testing products, there is plenty of work to do to make a perfect purchase. This may be the reason why some go for bread and milk and forget about it, after entering a colourful and attractive store. All in all, I strongly believe that shopping is not enjoyable by the vast majority. Fortunately, this unnavoidable part of our lives is not that problematical anymore, as we may experience the pleasures of online shopping without leaving home. It is a perfect alternative to save time, money and energy for those who are not that willing to hit the mall.",

She always wanted to be in the spotlights, in which she had always succeeded, since everyone adored her. Quite understandable, because Jennifer had the most beautiful, big blue eyes as well as thick blonde hair, a magnificent smile and an outstanding shape. Until we received that remarkable letter, I had always been in her shadow.\nAnyway, just before the letter arrived, we were sitting in the living room. I was doing homework, while Jennifer was posing for the mirror. \"Oh my God, I look absolutely gorgeous in this dress!,\" she shouted. \"Don't you think I should wear this during the premiere?\" \nShe was expecting a letter of the local drama club, in which they would reveal the character list of their new play. Jennifer had auditioned, and she was 100% sure that she would become the main woman. I had also auditioned, only because my best friends pushed me very hard, and I was 100% sure that I wouldn't even get a small role in the play.\nThen, suddenly, we heard something falling on the doormat. \"Oh my God, oh my God, that must be the letter of the drama club!\", Jennifer screamed. She immediately ran to the doormat, ran back to the living room and showed me the envelope in her hands. I looked up as she opened the envelope. Jennifer started to read the letter aloud, very excited - at first.\n\"Dear Jennifer and Carly Brown, We are delighted to inform you that Carly is chosen to become the main woman of our new play. Well done, Carly! We found your audition amazing. Unfortunately, your audition was really bad, Jennifer, so we could not give you a role in our play. Kind regards, The Cornish Drama Club.\"\nI couldn't believe my ears! I, Carly Brown, the insipid and far less interesting sister of the great Jennifer Jones, the most beautiful girl in town, was chosen to become the main woman in a big play! I, and not my sister! She wasn't even given a small role in the play.\nFrom that moment on, I haven't been in Jennifer's shadow anymore - she was in my shadow.\n",

  "text": "The industrial revolution took place in England from the end of 18th century to the middle of the 19th and it completely transformed this place. English economy changed from an agriculture one to an industrial one: in England there was an increase in pollution and also terrible hygienic conditions, the landscape changed a lot and also houses, shops and people. \nThese strong changes influenced very much the poetry and we can see that for example in Blake, because in \"The Tyger\" he uses a lot of colors referred to the industrial life (red, orange, silver..) and he describes the Tyger's creator as an artisan that create it on a furnace.  \nInstead the American and French revolutions are important because they introduced the idea of freedom, fraternity and equality , so also these concepts influenced strongly the poetry of the period. \nWe can see the conceit of freedom in Shelley's \"Ode to the West Wind\" , where the wind is wild and it is the very symbol of freedom ; instead , in the \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" , we can see the brotherhood of mariners in the ship and of party guests and also the equality of all the God's creatures. The idea of brotherhood is present also in \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by Wordsworth because he sees nature, daffodils in this case, as a friend to men.\n",

  "text": "                                               \n      During recent thirteen years, the cost of living has been significantly increasing in most countries. This change makes most people have to work every day even using their private time, so they need to find out the best way to save their time and fill their energy after work. Fast food is one of ways to solve that problem. This essay will examine some advantages and disadvantages of eating fast food.\n\n\n      There are huge positive effects of eating fast food. First of all is convenience. People who have just done their work are very hungry; they cannot go to home and cook their diet meals by themselves but their bodies need to be provided energy in order to sustain their lives and continue their jobs, so junk food is considered the best way to solve the hunger. To make it clear, the bosses, who are always busy in their business, usually eat fast food, they go to KFC or Lottie Mart to buy them they even might get fast food by phone because of fast delivery. In addition, Junk food is very easy to be found out. There are numerous stores and restaurants which have junk food built everywhere. Therefore, finding a good place to buy and enjoy a meal with fast food is not so difficult and it will not take time for people to go back their work on time.\n\n      On the other hand, eating fast food frequently may lead to some negative effects on customer’s health. Firstly, fast food is unhealthy. Junk food contains large unhealthy chemicals such as high percentage of fat and cholesterol which are the most reasons leading customers to obesity and cancers. According to scientists they said that people who usually eat plenty of junk food will have more than 50% of risks to get obese and even die soon. Furthermore, most of junk food just solves hunger in a short time and then it will quickly return to the customers after they have felt full. Finally is the loss of traditional meals. People prefer buying and eating fast food to making a healthy meal. As the consequence, they gradually forget how to cook a simple meal and the diversity of healthy food is slightly gone.  \n     In conclusion, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of fast food.

  "text": "    Facebook is the most popular social networking site of all time. Within 6 years, Facebook has reached  more than 1 billion users and still growing rapidly.\n    I wouldn't consider myself against it, although I am aware of the risks.\n    First of all, I think Facebook, for example, is a great way for shy people to socialize, because it can boost their self-esteem, considering the fact that they don't have to meet anyone face-to-face. It's also great if we want to manage our friendships, or create new ones. As a shy person, I can confirm the differences between real life and virtual interacion.\n    Social networking sites also benefit those who have \"unusual\" hobbies or those who have a hard time finding people with similar interests. For example, if you want to find someone who likes the same movie genders or series on social media, all you have to do is type in an interest.\n    On the other hand, we are also exposed to many risks, such as cyberbullying or online predators. While it can seem harmless, cyberbullying causes many problems among teenagers, such as depression, suicidal thoughts or even worse.\n    Spending too much time on the internet also has harmful effects on our family lives, because we tend to forget how important it is to spend time with those who love us.\n    To conclude, although social media seems flawless, we should always be careful and responsible before we sign up.",

  "text": "People and Change”\nThis is certainly true and corresponds with my experience. Some people do manage to stay in the same place all their lives and even work for the same company, while others are much more mobile in terms of their jobs and homes.\nI feel that this can be attributed in the first instance to the changing nature of modern societies. In the past, it was the norm for people to live in a limited geographical area all their lives and be involved in the same type of occupation all their working lives. There was simply no alternative to this, especially if you lived in an agricultural society. However, with the rise of industry and specialized companies, it became possible for workers to move jobs, often to places far away.\nFollowing on from this, as a society’s wealth increased, people had skills and training to allow them to be much more selective about which employer they want to work for and choices about how and when they wanted to change the type of job they wished to do. We are, therefore, in a situation in many countries today where to be highly mobile is something\nthat people take for granted and regard as perfectly normal.\nWith the opportunity for change comes choice, although circumstances, economic and personal, can often force people to do what they might not normally choose. Therefore, it happens that some people want change in their lives but are not able to effect it. This might be because they have strong obligations to family, might need to look after someone or might simply not have marketable skills to find a livelihood somewhere else. There are others, of course, who are quite happy to live and work in the same place all their lives because they do not think moving would enhance their lives. Some are happy to stay put because they would find it very stressful to endure change.\nIt is perhaps the majority nowadays who find change refreshing because of the new opportunities it holds out and the possibilities of getting on professionally and socially. For myself, I very much belong to this group.",

She tied the boat with long and very strong textiles made out of synthetic fibers that she found on the plane; she also used nails to join some new and more resistant wood into the boat. She was ready to leave but something inside her was telling her to stay, the boat was very resistant but not enough to travel for days and maybe weeks across the ocean, she was afraid. Meanwhile Jacob is completely in love with that girl he met weeks before, her name was Scarlett, she said that her dad was in the military and was working on a high-tech portable device that will change gravity in low levels and in a short period of time, like a fraction of a second, but it was later suspended because their boss told them it was very dangerous to experiment on and it was going to be very expensive, but as her dad continued with the experiment his boss got so mad he kicked them from the city into that mysterious island. She also explained that they didn't know how the majority of people on the island got there, thereby not all of them spoke the same language, but they learned how to communicate with signs. They had a lot of things in common, they liked the same kind of music, the same kind of food and they both liked to read about fantasies and comics. Jacob told her again if she wanted to go with him to a better place but she still denied, until she accepted with only one condition, if all her family could go with them. Jacob told Jessica if they could leave the island with Scarlett's family, she was not happy about it but she said yes. But they needed to make the boat even more resistant and rigid so it will support all the family and all the extra food they will need.",

  "text": "\n\nAbortion is a controversial issue in our society today. Some Pro-choice groups and individuals believe that a person have to right of choice, this includes the right to decide if they want to give birth or not. Contradicting the Pro-choice groups , Pro-life supporters consider terminating any pregnancy unjustifiable. Even though in some circumstances, such as life threatening and sexual abuse pregnancies, it could be the best thing to do. Hence, every woman must be able to have abortion as a choice.\n\nAbortion can be given as an option in life threatening.pregnancies. The presence of a mother is important in a child’s life especially in the first few months. During the first months , he relationship between a mother and a child rapidly develops. The baby's inborn capacity of imitation and regulation of visual and auditive stimulation, is gradually patterned and this is supported by the mother's empathetic response. (Lier.l,1988)  This natural process would be interrupted by the absence of the mother and the child’s development could be in this case negatively influenced. Development of emotional and psychological problem such as maternal deprivation can be a result. The child will have difficulties building and sustaining relationships during adult-life. Because of this risk abortion can be considered an option. Besides, abortion could also be considered in case of impregnation as a result of sexual abuse.\n\nImpregnation as a result of sexual abuse is not uncommon and in these cases abortion should be a choice. Sexual violence has a devastating impact on victims, all areas of a victim’s life is affected . Recovering is a hard and complicated  process and when you add a pregnancy to this equation it just makes it even more painful.  In fact, this is the main reason why sexually assaulted victims choose to have an abortion. Many victims believe that the additional trauma related to carrying their rapist child can be avoided by terminating the pregnancy, and therefore help them put the assault behind them and recover more quickly. Even though, not all victims will choose to have an abortion it has to be given as an option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if, abortion has to be given as a choice in special cases, it is not a solutions for  accidental pregnancies. It is for  the person who decides to have coitus to make sure to use appropriate anti conception.  Otherwise, you may run the risk that people seeing abortion as an easy way to get rid of an unwanted pregnancy. In order to prevent this, it is important to apply strict guidelines regarding situation where abortion is given as an option.\nAbortion only has to be approved as an option in life threatening.pregnancies  or if the mother has been sexually molested. Undeterred by this, it still the mother’s decision if she wants to save her own life or carry  and care for her rapist child.\n",

As a matter of fact students are often seen as empty pitchers ready to be filled by as many information as they can contain. Teachers shouldn't talk about their subjects without caring if their students are really listening to what they're saying or not, and they shouldn't let them study just because they must. They should make their students live school as a pleasant experience, as something their future is based on.\n\nSecondly,in his letter the professor suggests that schools should spend more money on computer equipment. I agree with this recommendation because I think it's important for schools to make the same progresses the society does year by year, offering always new materials and technologies, such as computers or interactive whiteboards in classrooms, making studying more interesting and sometimes also easier.\n\nThis is what, in my opinion, must be changed in schools to satisfy the society necessities and overcome the old and inappropriate \"out-of-date\" system.",

Many people feel that it is good to do their student life easier. However, it also has some disadvantages.\nOn the one hand, I firmly believe that students can find more valuable information on textbooks because they have existed for many centuries. For this reason, I believe that they have content more reliable. Furthermore, if you go to a library, you could spend all day seeing books and learning about different things so in these places there are many ancient books.\nOn the other hand, I personally think that pupils enjoying more working with textbooks because they can do this activity with classmates and they can help each other. Also, in my opinion, young people should not use computers for much time because this could be dangerous for their health, appearing sight problems or headaches.\nTaking everything into account, in my opinion every student should have a good encyclopaedia at home because it is much better for their education.\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "If you've been following my blog, you'll know that I've been on a journey of discovery and creation concerning using technology to create materials and using technology to teach.  \n\nI have just started teaching a new, face to face group of adults.   I was excited to get back into the classroom, I mainly teach online today, and try out some of my new skills on a group. I checked the equipment: I had a computer and projector, both in good working order, a fast internet connection and a full class.  I was ready and raring to go.....\n\nAs soon as the lights went out, the atmosphere changed in the classroom and I felt the tension rise. One student said that she couldn't see well, another student complained that the writing was too small, another felt she was getting too hot from the projector. The group's native language is Amharit; they have all had to learn Hebrew, so English is a third or for some of them a fourth language.  I'd chosen a method of teaching that was not suitable for the group.  This is a group of beginners, the experience of a first lesson with a new teacher is daunting enough, without adding unfamiliar technology and teaching methods. So I switched off the projector, took out my white board pen, dusted off my flash cards and reverted back to traditional methods of teaching.  \n\nWe've had three lessons so far and I'm thoroughly enjoying teaching this group; it's a pleasure to teach face-to-face and a challenge to teach adults at this level; it's really great to get 'back to basics'.    This experience has reminded me that although there are many advantages to using technology in the class room, it's not always appropriate and it's helped me to establish some equilibrium in my teaching methods.\n\nInstead of creating some online lessons for this  wonderful group, I have taken the opportunity to create some new printable materials to hand out in class. \n\nThis post will be the first of three on the topic of the Present Simple tense, it contains a printable infographic covering the basics of the Present Simple and two printable worksheets.

  "text": "Are young people less healthy than they were years ago?\n\nNowadays, there is an increasing concern about the health of young people, since there is no doubt that it is getting worse.\n\nTo begin with, recent statistics reveal that obese adolescents' ratio is rising. As well as that, the lifestyle of our society is pushing us to be more passive. And last but not least, it seems that new technologies are not helping to develop their social and intellectual skills.\n\nThe reasons could be, firstly, fast food is cheaper and very accessible for young people. In addition, spending too much time in activities like watching TV, surfing the Internet or playing video games prevent them from doing sports.  And finally, teenagers may become more dependent and introverted because of electronic devices such as mobile phones or personal computers.\n\nActually, it is not complicated to change habits in order to be healthier. For instance, filling the fridges with a great amount of fresh fruit and vegetables, doing some exercise and have some fun with friends regularly.\n",

I'm taking a year off and staying in London for six months so I hope you can help me if it isn't too much to ask.\n\nI'd like to find a part-time job but first of all I have to find an apartment to live, so I was wondering if you can look for a small apartment where I can live in; it would be better if it's near the underground station and in the city centre so that I can go sightseeing in my free time. Maybe you wouldn't mind helping me to find a job. Would you be so kind as to let me know if there are some restaurants or pubs that need staff? I'm looking for a well-paid job because I know that houses are expensive in the city centre.\n\nI'm looking forward to being there, I also need to take a rest and that's the reason why I want to find a part-time and not a full-time job.

  "text": "Advances in computer science have created a tremendous leap in technical innovations. One of the most recent outstanding innovations is robotics. Lavine, Voss and Coontz (2007) define robotics as the combination of “automation with action and at times a considerable amount of mobility” which is “becoming more and more humanoid”(p. 1083). The more computer science influences human’s lives, the more important status robotics has in the field of engineering. Only a decade year ago, robotics was just limited to scientific research. However, today it is used in more fields, such as medical treatment, elderly-nursing and archaeological studies, as well as education. This essay will discuss the current social consequences of robotics in the area of education, and then conclude by commenting on its possible future implications.\n\nIn the first place, robotics activity could provide learners with real situations which are related to irrelative courses, especially in scientific and medical ones. Tanzawa et al. (2012) described an experiment from Showa University which aimed to test how well dental students could deal with emergency situation. The result indicated that although the patients were merely robots, out of 98 candidates, only 22% students correctly gave the diagnoses. From a survey, 78% and 72% of students considered robot patients to be useful in medical emergency and risk training, whilst 63% of them thought it had a great value in training for surgical treatment. It is obvious that in this experiment, students could acquire knowledge more effectively and teachers could also realize weakness of students specifically.\nSecond, robotics can be taken advantage of to make studying and teaching effective and efficient. University of Southern Denmark organized an experiment, which aimed to examine how well robotics techniques named I-BLOCKS (a modular electronic building block system) could do on language tests. Surprisingly, the result illustrated that these robots can not only put words in right order grammatically , but also recognise whether a sentence is correct or not. Furthermore, the I-BLOCKS application could also build structures of robots which are smart to react to surroundings, and build binary expression to calculate in real-time and show both final results and sub-results (Lund, Marti, & Palma, as cited in Nielsen & Lund, 2008 ). With the help of robotics, like I-BLOCKS, students and teachers might spend less time on studying and some sophisticated processes are simplified as well.\n\nNevertheless, robotics is not that satisfying because it is complicated to operate which is always the reason why operators are distracted. Suh et al. ( 2010 ) described an experiment that aimed to test differences of time on operating robots to do tasks. Two groups of participants were asked to do suture-tying task and a secondary task with distraction, such as decision-making, memory-task. They are Group A: ten medical students aged 19-27 who only had general knowledge about surgery, and Group B: four experienced surgical postgraduates. It was found that there was an apparent difference on average speed and completion time when comparing tasks from students with basic knowledge and the one from another group. Moreover, in the task with distraction, experienced group was 1/3-1/2 faster in analyzing. Even though it becomes more efficient to study with robotics’ help, uneasy operating requires much time. Perhaps being familiar with robotics and good at operating could help out of this shortage.   \n\nToday, more people not only in the field of education, but also in different fields, have made use of robotics as tools to deepen their exploring and studying. It is possible that the robotics would be a normal part of individual’s lives. Mordoch et al.(2012) made some examples of robotics in daily lives: social human-robot, social assistive robot, therapeutic robot, mental commitment robot, care robot, robot-therapy. To a country, robotics could be new weapons for the future technological wars. However, there is some debate that it is against ethics to let warrior robots participate in modern wars and fight with real soldiers (Troop, 2012 ). Because of its unlimited potential, robotics will be used far more widely in the future. However, disadvantages of robotics and some social or ethical problems should be considered carefully while robotics is contributing to human’s lives.\n\nIn conclusion, with technology and computer science developing, application of robotics widens from scientific research to a variety of fields now. Besides influences on education, robotics has an effect on medical treatment, nursing and even design to future war as well. Even though robotics brings more beneficial consequences and advantages than its disadvantages, its shortcomings still should not be neglected and more scientific research should be done to improve application of robotics.",

  "text": "Is there no future for public transport? It directly depends on the city in which you live but, as time goes by, public transport becomes more and more necessary.\nLiving in a big city is always a big challenge. You usually have to commute to work and it takes you several hours per week to get to your office. Public transport allows you to save time and money in commuting. Besides, it offers you spare time to read and listen to music, provided you can find a seat and have a calm trip.\nPublic transport is so necessary in big cities that car industry is continuously developing new means of transport. Not only can customers choose a wide range of transport to commute, but they can also discover technologies that are not available for private purposes. \nOn the other hand, public transport is not so accepted in small villages, as it is not possible to offer a wide range of services and timetables. In small cities it is easiest to travel by car.\nIn any case, public transport is far from having no future. On the contrary, it should widen its goals and continue offering new services for the time being.",

Some places have scenic beauty in abundance while many are famous for their architectural wonders. In addition every person has different tastes, choices and preferences. Some people enjoy the sight of scenic beauty; some are attracted towards places of historical and archaeological interests.\n\nI have visited many historical and tourist places in many countries like Belgium, Great Britain, Spain and others. But the visit which has a lasting impression on my mind is the visit of Red Square. It is the most beautiful place I have ever seen in Moscow.\n\nNowhere expresses Moscow, Russia’s vast and ancient capital like Red Square. An enormous 400 by 150 metres, Red Square lies in the centre of Moscow and on its four sides stand the Kremlin, GUM (Department Store), State Historical Museum and Cathedral of the Protection of Most Holy Theotokos (aka St. Basil's Cathedral) centres of government, commerce, history and religion. The square is also home to Lenin’s tomb, a granite mausoleum to the revered founder of Socialism.\n\nThe must-see place is St. Basil's Cathedral, the beautiful architectural symbol of Russia. It includes domes, cupolas, arches, towers, and spires is sure to inspire you every bit as much in real life as in the photos. \n\nAt the northern end of the square you will find the State History Museum with its huge collection of artefacts charting Russia’s past right back to the stone age.\n\nAll these and many more like its cultural places, famous streets connected to square and gorges as well as old buildings make it “spirit of Moscow”. Indeed, the beauty of Moscow is enchanting and have unique spirit.\n",

  "text": "Compare and contrast Dickens' and the Brontë sisters' style of writing.\n\nThe main feature of Dickens' and the Brontë sisters' style of writing is realism. All these Victorian novelists use very detailed descriptions of places, people and feelings in order to make their novels as realistic as possible. Anyway, Dickens' style is that of sentimental realism, which mixes comedy and pathos, while the Brontë sisters' realism is plenty of Romantic and Gothic elements and it's widely influenced by the desolate English Moors, where they grew up.\n\nIn addition, Dickens, as long as Charlotte and Emily Brontë in some of their novels, uses quite frequently the first-person narration. For example, in \"David Copperfield\", Dickens's most autobiographical novel, the story is talked with a first-person narration with the point of view of the protagonist as an adult. Charlotte Brontë uses the same technique in Jane Eyre, her masterpiece. Finally, in all cases, the stylistic choices are closely linked with the themes they deal with, which always concerned social issues.",

Nevertheless, a strong and balanced mind plays a huge role in the game of tennis, as shown by famous tennis champions, like Michael Chang and Justine Henin. Much shorter than their fellow colleagues, they have always been able to compensate for their physical lacks with an extremely good tecnique accompanied by a strong head.\n\nMoreover, tennis can be seen as a metaphor of life. You are alone on the tennis court to face your contender. It is a battle where you can count only on yourself. Though you might be fighting for long and getting tired and tired, you have to search for the strength inside yourself to continue and reach the end of the tennis match.\n\nTennis also gives a message of hope. You have never to surrender: until the last ball has bounced twice on the ground, you have to keep fighting, regardeless of the score. Fate may play a role but you have still to try and bring out the best of yourself.\n\n\nTennis is considered a very individualistic sport. Nonetheess, it helps to shape your own personality.\n\nI would definitely recommend whoever would like to start this sport to approach it with a good spirit.

We could go shopping in the city centre, they have some very cool stores that we both will be able to enjoy even a Primark and I haven’t seen some shops anywhere else yet. Furthermore there is a huge and cool movie theatre where we could watch a film together, since they’ve got some very exciting films coming out. Or else there are some pubs we could visit, most of the time I quite enjoy going to a pub on the weekends myself, but it’s all up to you.

  "text": "1.    INTRODUCTION \n\nThe aim of this paper is to show, through a transitivity analysis of the lyrics from three different songs, how language has influenced roles of gender\n\nThe questions we are going to answer about these songs are:\n\n• Although the performers are women, is the language used sexist? \n\n• Does anyone feel like a victim ?\n\n\nThe structure is divided in these sections:\n\n- Method: Data selection- The three songs we will be analyzed and the reasons why we’ve chose them\n\n- Theoretical background- A review of our knowledge. We will explain some concepts that we will use later in our analysis.\n\n- Analysis: This part is the practical part that will answer our questions. The lyrics will be explained. Our tools will be transitivity analysis and language. Furthermore, we will give some examples of clauses that represent better the meaning of our songs.\n\n\n- Conclusions: The questions we made before will be answered. With our analysis done, this final part is where the results of our work is written and we can tell the difference between these songs and what we thought at the beginning\n\n- Bibliographical references: The part where the sources are revealed\n\n \n2.    METHOD: DATA SELECTION  \n\n\tWe are going to compare the lyrics from the following three songs: Miley Cyrus’ Wrecking Ball; Anastasia’s Left Outside Alone; and Taylor Swift’s Back to December. We have chosen these three songs because they all deal with the same topic of breaking-up, but they describe this topic from different  points of view, even though the three songs are performed by female singers. \n\n These songs are relatively modern, but if we take a look we will find some sexism  in some parts. \n\n However, there’s a hope for women to find a song that doesn’t treat them like an inferior gender. This is the case of the “free choice” song, Taylor Swift.\n\n Still, women are the victim in three different ways. We will search for these situations that share the feelings of regret, made by some specific situations.\n\n Anastasia’s song tells a story of a victim, meanwhile the others talk about women that fell guilty because they have hurted men.\n \n Also, we think that these songs can represent different kinds of processes and language we have seen in class .\n\n\n\nThe material  processes are also known as the processes of doing. This is because they express an action or an activity. This type of process has been found in the three songs and it is very prolific. Usually, in these types of songs, the performers  describe actions in the relationships as well as at the  end of it. The material processes are carried out by agents, which coincide with the subject. The subject of the sentence can also be the force if the agent is inanimate. We have found this kind of agent in the songs with the love relationship as the subject. In this category of processes, there is another participant known as the affected, because the action of the verb affects or concerns it.\n\nIn our research, the cognition verbs have been the most common inside of the group of the mental ones followed by the affection ones, which is quite normal when describing a love relationship \n\nSONG ANALYSIS:\n\nThe main participants are the woman and the man. The woman uses mental and material processes the same amount of times. Regarding mental processes, cognition is  the type more used.\n The material processes show  some actions that the girl would like to erase because them only make emotional abuse to the man . She feels sorry because she did not  care about him in this delicate situation. As we can see, the boy gave her love and she just want to leave him.\n Although the reason for the break-up is not totally clear, the girl is saying that it was all her fault. The boy did not do anything wrong.\n If we look to the boy processes, we will find only positive things. The processes that appears more usually are mental and relational (attributive type). These cases are always regarding good actions or showing the good characteristics of the man \n.\n On the other hand, the woman just say “I’m sorry”. The mental processes, specifically the cognition ones, tells us that she had thought a lot about what she did and that she is wrong. \n The other participants appears a few times, but these participants tell us important  things about the relationship. She cares about him , about his life and his family (even though she didn’t care before).\n Consequently, these participants give us some keys to understand better the situation, but actually they just confirm what the girl feels. She is regreting because their relationship get worse and it wasn’t what she supposed it could be. She wants him, but “the chain is on his door”. She broke up, but now she is on his hands. This can only be explained because he is a good boy and she was (probably ) confused.\n Although now she is sure, she had suffered a lot. “The cold” and “the fear” was inside her. She feels bad, but she doesn’t really know what to say.\n Even though, there’s a sentence that can confuse anyone. She says “swallowing my pride”. She has to do it, and is a sacrifice. Maybe she feels bad, but not completely guilty. This sentence shows a girl who thinks she is not really bad, though she knows she could have done things better.\n Obviously, she can’t say a bad thing about him, but we don’t really know what he thinks about her. There are some clues in sentences like “Your guard is up” or “the last time you saw me is still burning in the back of your mind”. This means he still loves her, but at the same time he’s still hurt. He is confusedly in love.\n Finally, the woman tells him that she would understand that he doesn’t want to restart the relationship, but she makes a promise: \n“If we loved again, I swear I’d love you right”.\nThe problem is that maybe is too late and she only can wish “I’d realized what I had when you were mine”. This sentence and some others sound like if they were  pronounced by a man…\n",

  "text": "Learning a new language is always an exciting experience. There could be many reasons that lead to the need to learn new languages but, the advantages are vast. Learning a new language gives you a chance to see the many things that are around you in a different aspect. You will thus broaden your way of thinking and in the end as you learn you will enhance your intelligence. However, you need to understand that learning a new language is not an easy task. You need to invest your time and energy in it so as to achieve results. There is a lot of stress associated with it, bearing in mind that in most cases a new language will revolve around a culture that is different from what you are used to. Enthusiasm to learn is all that you will need so as to get the first few steps done. After the first few words, you will like the experience and will be hard for you to stop. It is always interesting to communicate with natives of a foreign language comfortably.\nThe most important thing is to have positive thoughts. You may find the first initial stages of real stress. You may even feel like giving up. Encouraging yourself that you can work perfectly well for you. To speed up the learning process, you need to read many comic books in the language that want to learn. I will be hard to understand everything that you read but the pictures in the comic books will help you. In time, you will get to learn many new words. You also need to choose books of your favorite authors. This is important because you understand their way of writing and will be easy to understand. Enrolling in different forums that are in the language you want to learn will be of great aid to you. However, you need to choose forums with eloquent speakers as it is the only way you will gain much.",

  "text": "Proposal for the development of a sports activity.\n\nIntroduction\nSports are all around the community. They improve our health and help people interact with each other. Those are a few reasons why it is important for us as a healthy group of people to have facilities in which we can practice this kind of activities.\n\nThe chosen one\nIn my opinión running is one of the most helpful sports when it comes to start moving and getting fit, in particular for those people who have not been doing any kind of physical activity for a long time. This activity would not demand huge amounts of money to be done and with a non-significant investment would help a large group of people who desperately need it.\n\nMinimal investment with huge benefits\nTo start running this community will need a few things. To begin with, it is important that the government develops a program which creates social awareness. A significant part of the population in this town do not know the importance of practising sports and having a healthier life. \nOnce people know all the benefits this sport has, they will need a space where to practice it comfortably. With  this in mind money would be spent on constructing a running rute where no-one would have to worry about traffic or obstacules in their way.\n\nBenefit for all ages\nThere are almost no contraindications to practise this sport so almost everybody in the town has the opportunity to try it at least once. This activity not only improves your body and health but also helps you have positive thoughts making everyone feel happier.\n\nConclusión\nIn my opinion improving the practice of this sport will be a great investment for our community and will have a great impact on our health and in our everyday lives.",

  "text": "    The lecture and the reading passage both discuss how to stop the spread of cane toads in Australia. However, the lecturer argues against the reading passage. The reading passage mentions three ways to prevent cane toads from spreading, while the speaker offers three reasons to refutes the reading passage.\n    The first point, suggested by the lecturer, is that national fence can not stop cane toads from spreading. The cane toads' eggs and young cane toads can spread to other areas from the streams and rivers. Unless the national fence can prevent the eggs and young can toads from moving through the water way, the fence is useless. Thus, the lecture disputes the idea mentioned in the article that building a national fence could avoid the spreading.\n    The lecturer's second argument invovles capturing and destroying the toads by volunteers. It is argued in the listening passage that untrained volunteers could harm the native frogs which are endangered. Because the young frogs look alike, it is possible that the volunteers will kill frogs other than cane toads. In short, the lecturer questions what is stated in the reading passage that prevent the spreading by volunteers capturing the cane toads.\n    Finally, it is argued in the listening passage that disease-causing virus that killed the toads could be a disaster. The lecturer says that if the virus was bring to the original habitats of cane toads in South America, it will cause ecological damage to the local ecosystem. To sum up, the lecturer doubts the way mentioned in the reading that specially designed virus could specifically harm cane toads and prevent them from spreading.\n    To conclude, the lecturer discords with the ideas in the passage by presenting three convincing reasons. National fence, volunteers, and virus are not good solutions to the cane toads spreading problem.",

It it hard to believe that Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise is still able to reinvent himself carry the weight of a blockbuster franchise like the \"Mission: Impossible\" series, much more so after considering the fact that he is now in his early fifties, and still looks as fresh as he did in the 25 years old \"Days of Thunder\".\n\nTo start, \"Rogue Nation\" follows the same basic formula of the movies preceding it: fast-paced action, a focus on the espionage and gadgetry of the core team, and some of the most breathtaking set pieces Hollywood has to offer. Together with a solid foe and the deft and stylish hand of director Christopher McQuarrie, all elements combine to give this fifth outing a refined sense of urgency, perfecting the pace to deliver constant, ever-topping thrills.\n\nFinally, a special mention goes for Joe Kraemer's superbly thrilling score, just a masterclass of old-school, kickass orchestral action music. With all things considered, the bottom line is that Cruise & Co have delivered what has to be considered as the finest film in the series yet.",

  "text": "The social debate between progress and traditions has been going on for centuries. Through our customs, we celebrate our past and keep our cultural heritage alive. But it is also because of these set of beliefs, mostly of religious origins, that some societies fail to evolve and respond to the ever-changing needs of all of their people. \n\nOne of the main advantages of cutural practices is that they allow societies to maintain their identities and gain economic stability. In most Latin American countries, millenary practices such as silversmithing, not only keep the region in touch with its heritage, but they have become the sole source of income for many communities. Nations like Mexico and Peru, with internationally recognized cuisines, have taken advantage of their culinary roots and boosted the production of locally grown foods, like chipotle peppers and quinoa, to bring economic growth to their agriculture sectors.  \n\nOn the other hand, the greatest disadvantage of traditions, is that religious beliefs have kept these very same populations from social and human rights progress. Gay marriage and reproductive rights are not recognized by the Costa Rican and most Latin governments, all because of the set of beliefs of a percentage of their community.\n\nIn conclusion, traditions should be cherished and kept alive for future generations. However, the safekeeping of these practices should never become a priority over the wellbeing of the collective. Progress and traditions are not opposites in a socie ty were respect and tolerance for others is the priority.  ",

  "text": "“Prison has long been the traditional punishment for people who commit crimes. Some people believe, however, that community service orders are more appropriate in some cases. When do you think that it is right to order people to work in the community to pay for their crimes?”\nIn recent years, the most common punishment for criminals has been prison. There are certain people who believe community service orders are more adequate in some cases. People who break the law, should be ordered to work in community in order to pay for their misdeeds, when they have done a minor offence or if they have acted unintentionally.\nCommunity service orders are more appropriate than prison punishments when people have acted unintentionally. Sending criminals to prison is a serious verdict for people that have made a mistake. Nobody is sinless and people should not be treated as serious as being sent to jail. For example, graffiti makers in Bulgaria are sent to prison for 4 years. This is unfair, because they do not do any harm to the environment nor to the society. It is better that they do a certain amount of community work, for example clean their graffiti, which will teach them how hard it is to clean graffiti, and thus, prevent them from making new ones.\nWorking in the community is more adequate compared to sending people to prison when criminals have done a minor offence. Limiting people’s freedom because of minor, non-harmful to the society crimes is inhumane. Everybody deserves freedom, despite its crimes. Although their misdeeds should not be tolerated, I believe that had better do some community work. This will help them understand their mistakes and prevent them in future. For example, in Bulgaria, people who lay down and relax on the grass in the park are sent to jail for 6 years, because they are considered “doing serious damage to the environment and preventing the park from further development”.\nCommunity service orders should be used when people have acted unintentionally and when they have conceded a minor offence, as this will help them realize their mistakes, without them being limited in freedom by being sent to prison. This will help them realize their mistakes and thus, quit doing them.\n",

The plot is about a teenage girl who moves in with her mother to their dream house, which was next to a home where a horrible double homicide had taken place in. As soon as they move in, they hear the rumors of the incident: a little girl brutally murdered her parents in the middle of the night and disappeared, and the other child of the family recently moved in there.\nAs the movie develops, it has lots of interesting turns that let the viewer form his/her own conclusions. I myself am a fan of horror movies, which are highly predictable, so it was a great satisfaction to see such a complex film. The end completely blew me away and I believe it was the best part of it. The acting was smooth and credible. \nAlthough it had bad critics, the movie was well received by the audience; not to mention Jennifer Lawrence's appearance right after the hit of Hunger Games was great for advertising.\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this film for those who like drama and plot twists.\n\n",

Many people feel that these machines are now an essential part of our lives, but how necessary are they really?\n\nOne of the main advantages is the time that can be saved by using a computer. This is especially beneficial in the workplace, where employees can do their work far faster than they could in the past. In addition to this, computers can be educational and fun. From a very young age children can gain basic computer skills through programmes that allow them to learn, draw, paint and play. In today’s technological world, this knowledge can only help them in the future.\n\nHowever, there are various negative aspects to using com¬puters. Many jobs have been lost due to the fact that computers can do a lot of tasks more efficiently than humans. This has led to high unemployment in many countries. What is more, computers can actually cause health problems. Endless hours in front of a screen can cause eye strain and headaches, which are serious side-effects.\n\nTo sum up, it seems that computers are a useful addition to our fast-moving world of high technology. However, it must be remembered that they are here to serve us – not to replace us.\n",

  "text": "Social networking is a tool used by people all around the world. Its purpose is to promote and aid communication. However I think that this type of technology might be doing more harm than good. It is not only changing how we communicate, but how we interact with each other in daily life. All social networks have their own pros and cons but certainly there are some social networks that affect more than others.\n\nIn conclusion I can say that the social network that affects population the most is Facebook. It may be on the verge of replacing traditional personal interactions for the next generation. It  affects our lives in many ways, including our communication, self- expression, bullying, isolations, friendships, and even our very own sense of humanity.\n\nOn this networking site, users create pages that represent them in some way. They post pictures of themselves and their friends. Facebook has more bad effects in adolescents than in adults, they are known to be more mature about what they post and how they interact online. It is more likely that adults would, use their profile pictures as a way of casually showing themselves, their family, find new clients for their jobs or possibly a recent trip they took.\n\nTeenagers, however, use this technology in a way that could be dangerous. In this stage of their lives, they care more about their need to impress their peers than mature reasoning. Comments that are left on their pages mean more to them than words said face to face \n\nAdults need to teach teenagers the importance of not abuse from using social networks, specially Facebook.\nTeachers at school may improve more restrictions that make teenagers avoid using social networks in an extremely way.\nAt work, bosses may reduce employee´s salaries if their job gets affected because of distractions that are produced by social networks. \n",

  "text": "Proposal to improve School's facilities for language learners.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe aim of this proposal is to make recommendations in order to improve the school facilities. Aspects such as space, internet access and materials will be discussed in order to make suggestions to improve the service for students learning languages.\n\nFirst, an inspection to the school´s facilities was organised, in order to assess the  school premises. From the visit, it was concluded that even if the majority of students express satisfaction with the space, some of them wish  to have more classrooms that allow a more reasonable number of students per class.  Currently, each class is given to 50 students which limits their opportunities to experience one o one activities that enhance their learning process. It would be advisable to accommodate classes in the main building that offers enough space for smaller classes.  \n\nSecondly, It was surprising to evidence an absence of Internet access in the computer room. Even if the room counts with a considerable number of computers, the absence of Internet does not give students the opportunity to use the many websites useful to improve their language skills. Therefore, I strongly recommend guaranteeing internet access which does not represent a high cost for the academic board. The access will give learners the possibility to use technological tools that will ensure a better experience while learning languages.\n\nFinally, authentic material in foreign languages was not found in the school´s library. It is crucial to provide students with printed material in the target language. Magazines and newspapers allow learners to have direct contact with language in real contexts. Thus, I suggest to make subscriptions to international magazines in order to enrich the school's library.\n\nConclusion.\n\nI strongly believe that if the suggestions made in this proposal are given attention, the service provided to language learners will be strengthen and enhanced.

In fact, it is quite useful if you are actually interested in improving your skills, when it comes to listening and speaking.\nOn the other hand, I have been in search of the series which catches my attention and it took me very long until I finally put my finger on it. The TV series known as Downton Abbey is the best I have ever seen, and in the following lines I would like to explain why.\nIt is set in England during and after the First World War. The whole plot takes place in the area called Downton, the castle of Earl Lord Gratham, his family and the service staff. Although the story is focused on the Lord’s family, the service has an important part to play, as the world is changing continuously and the nobility is getting old-fashioned.\nThe main point in this series is that every character has been absolutely developed, with its own characteristics and personalities. Even the background is cleverly chosen what enhances the intriguing and dramatic script. Needless to say, the actors are sublime and they give their touch to their role, especially Maggie Smith, which is one of my favourite actress.\nBecause of all these reasons, I highly recommend taking into account Downton Abbey to be included in your top ten list.\n",

I am a Dean’s Fellow and Ph.D. candidate at XYZ University, currently revising the final chapter of my dissertation, and expecting to graduate in May 20XX. I am confident that my teaching experience and my research interests make me an ideal candidate for your open position.\nOver the past five years, I have taught a variety English courses. I have taught a number of American literature survey courses, as well as writing courses, including technical writing and first-year writing. I have extensive experience working with ESL students, as well as students with a variety of learning disabilities, including dyslexia and dysgraphia, and disabilities like ADD and ADHD. I pride myself in creating a classroom environment that accommodates the needs of my individual students while still promoting a high level of critical thought and writing skills. Some of my most satisfying experiences as a teacher have come from helping struggling students to grasp difficult concepts, through a combination of individual conferences, class activities, and group discussion. I know I would thrive as a teacher in your college, due to your belief in small classroom size and individualized support for students.\nNot only does my teaching experience suit the needs of your school and department, but my research interests also fit perfectly with your description of the ideal candidate. My dissertation project, “Ferns and Leaves: Nineteenth-Century Female Authorial Space,” examines the rise and development of American female authors in the 1840s and 1850s, with a particular focus on patterns of magazine publication. I argue that, rather than being submissive to the requirements of the editor or publisher, female authors in fact developed a more transparently reciprocal relationship between themselves and their readers than previously has been assumed. I apply recent print-culture and book-history theory to my readings of novels, magazine articles, letters, and diary entries by various female authors, with a particularly focus on Sara Willis (known by her pseudonym Fanny Fern). I plan to develop my dissertation into a book manuscript, and continue to research the role of female writers in antebellum magazine culture, with a particular focus on the rise and influence of female magazine editors on literary culture.\nMy research interests have both shaped and been shaped by my recent teaching experiences. Last spring, I developed and taught a course on the history of print culture in America. I combined readings on theory and literature that addressed issues of print with visits to local historical museums and archives. My students conducted in-depth studies on particular texts (magazines, newspapers, novels) for their final papers. I believe my interdisciplinary teaching style, particularly my emphasis on material culture, would fit in well with the interdisciplinary nature of your English department.\nI am therefore confident that my teaching experience, my skill in working with ESL and LD students, and my research interests all make me an excellent candidate for the assistant professor of English position at ABC College. I have attached my curriculum vitae and the two requested sample publications. I would be happy to send you any additional materials such as letters of reference, teaching evaluations, and past and proposed course syllabi. I will be available to meet with you at either the MLA or C19 conference, or anywhere else at your convenience. Thank you so much for your consideration; I look forward to hearing from you.\n",

  "text": "A transportation vehicle that has changed people’s live.\n\nThat transportation exerts a far-reaching influence on people’s daily routines and lifestyle is true. Not only that, what prides itself as the most influential vehicle—as most public recognized—is the automobile. \nThere are people who have never ridden a bicycle, and people who have never been on an airplane but it would be hard to find a person who has never been in a car. It is generally believed that the invention of car leads to the dispersion of the population out of urban centers, to the growth of the suburbs. Prior to the automobile, is the horse and wagon life, it is not feasible for people to live far from their place of work. The growth of the suburbs changed the face of American society, bringing with it a whole different way of life. Moreover, it leads to an important expansion in commerce, resulting in the growth of the ubiquitous shopping malls, department stores, serving as a powerful pull to tourism. \nWhat greatly increased mobility leads to significant changes, additionally, lies in various lifestyles. Being able to live far from one’s workplace, people could travel far and wide for pleasure and indulge themselves in a remarkable trip. It may be for a day, a week, or a period of time. In the urban city, the car is by far the most common mode of transportation and has greatly impacted the growth of the tourist industry. We are beginning to see people in countries with cars going out of the city on weekends and holidays. \nThough being good enough, yet the growth of population and mobility do not tell the whole story. This powerful vehicle is counted vital for another reason: being an indispensable factor in many aspects. It is the key that supports many industrial fields, such as steel, machinery, plastic. The whole business success would not have met perfection without the help of transportation to distribute their materials and commodities well. Last but not least, the booming prosperity often parallels the numbers of job in the city. \nAlthough other forms of transportation may be more comfortable, none has changed the way we do business and live our lives more than the car. Thanks to the speed, excitement, and convenience of the cars, our lives are enriched. ",

  "text": "JOb and social life both play important roles to put people's lives together. Some people tend to think that their jobs have more effect on their happiness, while others seem to believe that their social life has more of an influence. In my opinion, my social interaction balances my life more than does my working experience. As a result, I believe that my social life has more of an effect on my happiness. There are several reasons to support my position.\n\nFirst of all, family and friends whom we love always offer their support to comfort us. With the increasing competition in the workplace, people bear more and more stress. The companionship of our loved people is always the best solution to release our pressure. For example, every day it seems that an extremely tight deadline is always chasing after me, and makes me breathless. Meanwhile, I always feel exhausted and barely have any energy to talk with anyone after a long day from the work. However, I always can recover my energy after having a little nice chat with my family or friends. Therefore, the happiness brought from my social connections helps to alleviate the stress related to work.\n\nIn addition, attending social activities widens my life’s experiences wholesomely. Take my yoga class for example. Since I joined the yoga studio, I have made a lot of new friends. Besides yoga, most of them also have numerous other interests, like hiking, jogging, and baking. Meanwhile, they are friendly and willing to share their knowledge with me. Both learning new knowledge and making new friends make me feel delighted. Therefore, an active social life not only benefits my mental health but also keep me in a good mood.\n\nLastly, some people may think that co-workers naturally melt into our social life since we spend so much time in the workplace. This might suggest that being surrounded by people at work with whom we need to socialize would have more of an effect on our emotions. However, most of the time people keep a good relationship with their co-workers in order to accomplish their common task harmoniously. On the other hand, people are willing to discuss serious matters with their family and friends because of their shared bond of trust. For example, we talk about something trivial, such as gripes, and gossip, with our colleagues. Conversely, we share our deepest worries and problems with our close family and friends because we are not afraid of exposing our weakness to those people whom we trust. At the same time, we will also pay more attention to the people whom we love. Therefore, the more deeply our emotions interact, the more tremendously our happiness is influenced.\n\nIn conclusion, because of intimate support, growth in life experiences, and emotional interaction, I agree with the statement that the social life has more of an effect on my happiness than does my occupation. In other words, even though I can get temporary happiness from accomplishing a work task or gaining a compliment from my co-workers, personally I think I obtain more permanent enjoyment and satisfaction from engaging and interacting with the people that I love. As a result, I believe that my social life influences my personal happiness more than does my job.\n",

There was a large box standing in front of the door, addressed to me, while I had never received packages before! The only post ever sent to me was an anniversary card, sent by my grandmother before she passed away.\n\nStill a bit surprised, I grabbed the box up, which proved to be no picnic, as it felt as if it had been filled with rocks. Nonetheless, I managed to remove the box from the ground and staggered through the doorway, in the direction of the living room. While walking, I paid all my attention to carrying the box. If only I had looked a bit better where I placed my feet...\n\nAnyway, I didn't notice the skateboard which lay in front of my feet. When I stepped on it, I lost my balance and the box fell on the ground. I heard the sound of breaking glass. Immediately, I opened the box and found a short letter, saying: \"Dear Jane, here's the inheritance from your grandmother: her glass tea service...\"\n",

There are people who wouldn't be able to travel if it wasn't for public transport. Children and elders can't have a driving license, so if they need to go somewhere, using public transport is their only option. \n\nTravelling by car is also very detrimental for the environment. In big cities, the air is very polluted because there are too many cars. Travelling by public transport lowers the impact on the environment, something that most people are aware of, but still they prefer to use their own vehicle.\n\nUsing public transport can also save time, since you don't have to spend time looking for a place to park your car. I definitely think that public transport will continue to be very important in the future. ",

  "text": "In general, shopping is associated with something pleasant, but unfortunately this is not always true. There are some reasons why people leave shop in a bad mood, or even don't want to get in them. Shopping is not always enjoyable.\nFor some people, shopping is one of their obligations. For others it is overall a pleasant experience they cannot enjoy as much as they would like. \n\nFirstly, shopping may be uncomfortable, because more often than not we can  hear there tiring music, saleswomen can be too intrusive and the queue usually are very long. Sometimes women go to the store, just to watch the new stuff, to look around and questions asked by sellers make us angry.\n\nIn addition, shopping is also a problem for men. It is said that the man, who go shopping more than one hour is angry and tired. Sometimes it is also a trouble for women, who want to go shopping with her partner.\n\nTo sum up, doing shopping is inevitable, so we can  make everyday shopping more enjoyable. For exapmle, we can take at least one family member with us. This is a great opportunity to spend some quality time together, exchange ideas and opinions; opt for evening shopping, specifically about half an hour before the stores close if you want to avoid big crowds; if possible, choose  only one store for your everyday shopping. Going from one store to another can waste your time, cost you a lot in gas, as well as mentally and physically exhaust you; when it comes to products that your regularly use, buying in bulk is the best option you have, since that way you get a bigger quantity for a lower price; or just choose online shopping - is a great way to make your purchases from the comfort of your own home, without having to go out on a rainy day, deal with noisy (and sometimes  even smelly) crowds, spend money on gas and wait in huge lines.

  "text": "\n       First of all I would like to begin with giving some information about the city where the place that you will be visiting belongs to. The city of Istanbul is one of the famous and crowded cities of Turkey which constitutes the country's economic, cultural, and historical heart. The population of Istanbul is over 20 million and Istanbul is among the largest cities in the world by population within city limits. Historical Peninsula is the centre of ancient Istanbul where the four major empires had been ruled from. There are many historical places in the Historical Peninsula such as mosques, churches and palaces. The most important ones are Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Sultanahmet Mosque, Suleymaniye Mosque, Yeni Mosque, the Grand Bazaar, Basilica Cistern, Beyazit Tower and the Spice Bazaar. In order to give brief information on them I would like to touch on some of them. Hagia Sophia was built as a cathedral in 537, converted to a mosque after the conquest of Istanbul, now is being used as a museum. Topkapi Palace was built in 1470′s and Ottoman Empire was ruled from this palace for 380 years. The Grand Bazaar is one of the largest covered markets in the world and it has more than 4,000 shops. It is well known for its jewellery, pottery, spice, leather and carpet shops. Basilica Cistern was built in the 6th century and is the largest of several hundred ancient cisterns that still lie beneath the city of Istanbul; size of 143 by 65 meters, with capacity of holding 80,000 cubical meters of water. Beyazit Tower is 85 meter located in the courtyard of Istanbul University’s main campus in Beyazıt Square. The Spice Bazaar is the second largest covered bazaar after the Grand Bazaar. It stands next to Yeni Mosque. You can find many types of spices, herbs, nuts, Turkish delight, etc. \n       Actually I was asked to recommend only one place, but Historical Peninsula is already an area where those historical distincts got together. I hope the given information is useful for you.",

Being able to study in an English university will give me the opportunity to get a better job and an exciting experience.  As we all know,  nowadays,  English proficiency is on the list of the required skills to be employed and the market highly demands it.

I wanted to be a programmer since I was 14 years old. I was fascinated by this field of science. In addition, earning a fair amount of money is essential to building my life. For example, if I want to marry in the future, I have to be able to send my kids to a decent school and provide them with what they want. not to mention wedding party expenses.\nTo sum it up, graduating from an English university and then becoming a programmer are currently my mine aims.

  "text": "With the advent of individually owned vehicles like the car, an individual's dependence on public transport has certainly reduced. However, with that being said, in my opinion, there is still a lot of future for public transport. I'd like to highlight the factors that would support my opinion in a certain order that pertains to a wider acceptance. \nFirst of all, from a cost perspective, public transport is much cheaper compared to a car, especially when a cost reduction concept like 'car pooling' is not followed. The financial benefit that public transport gives to the common man is second to none, especially in common situations like long distance commutes for daily work. \nIn addition, from a 'time savings' angle, increased usage of public transport results in reducing traffic and helping people reach their destinations quicker by avoiding being delayed in traffic jams and lights.\nFrom an environmental standpoint, use of public transport ensures that carbon emissions from automobiles are prevented helping in preserving the balance of nature even in big cities like Tokyo and Delhi where the carbon emissions are very high.",

However, there's always a channel that sends out a new episode. Besides that, it's very likely that you can find some programmes you like between all the trash because of the wide variety.\n\nIn addition, the price of watching television for a whole month is much lower than the price of tickets for the cinema to watch a film for only two hours. Moreover, when you sit in front of the TV in your own house, you won’t get irritated by strangers, which may happen in the cinema. \n\nIn my opinion, TV provides something for everyone’s taste nowadays, including good quality programmes, for a reasonable price.

  "text": "When the American series ‘House’ was firstly broadcasted on TV, it immediately hooked the audience. The unusual scenario and the great actor Hugh Laurie made the result really innovative for a TV series.\n\nIt is based on Dr. Gregory House, a reputable diagnostician who uses strange and sometimes inappropriate approaches in order to find out what is wrong with his patients. He only agrees to take over cases nobody else could solve and most of the time he succeeds. Due to an unsuccessful surgery he had on his leg, he is addicted to painkillers which he makes several attempts to detox from motivated by his only friend Dr. Wilson, but he never really wants to so he gets addicted again. He is sarcastic and often mean, which drives people away from him. Nevertheless, he is willing to do literary anything to save a patient’s live, although sometimes he goes too far.\n\nThe series had a great appeal on many countries, which is demonstrated by the eight seasons that were produced. His revolutionary behaviour and the fact that he let nobody restrain him are the reasons for the series huge success. Also, the medical cases are intriguing and although someone with no medical knowledge may not understand much, the struggle to save a person’s life captures everyone’s interest. The innovative aspect of ‘House’ is that he often takes illegal action, for example breaking into a patient’s house to investigate environmental factors, which may have caused the particular disease and hardly ever is he punished for it.\n\nI believe it well deserved such popularity, as apart from its scenario, it was on the whole qualitative. My only objection is that it sometimes went too far which made the audience dislike Dr. House. Nevertheless, it distinct from other medical series as he constantly thinks out of the box.\n",

I was amazed with the atmosphere at the Coliseum, with its shiny wooden court, the noisy people around it, that sharp sound of the referees´s whistles...Then I decided to take up the game.\n\nI never imagined how hard the training was, how tiring and demanding the exercises were and how difficult to control the ball was.\n\nOnce I got fitter enough, I started enjoying the game, learning its strategies, developing personal and group skills and having fun at the same time.\n\nI would strongly recommend the youth to take up this sport . They will soon be engaged in a healthy, defiant and never boring activity and also will develop strong bonds with each other, responsibility and compromise. Volleyball is the best sport ever!",

  "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this proposal is to present suggestions regarding the ways in which the extra funding could be used if the benefit of the students and, indirectly, in the benefit of the local community. Needless to say, in order to combat the rising tide of the social problems in Hampshire, the Education Authority decided to increased funds for the educational sector.\nSports Club\nSportive activities might boots the student's overall condition and this is the reason why they are necessary. It is well known that physical activity contributes to improving physical and mental health.\nDrama Club\nThis kind of club will allow students to express their feelings in a non-violent manner, learn how to manage their reactions and develop creative talent. A drama club will make examining plays such as Shakespeares' more enjoyable than solely studying them will. \nCookery classes \nCookery classes are very important because students here are young adults that need to have basic skills such as cooking or order to manage themselves and live an independent life. Cooking classes will helps students spend less money on eating out and they will start eating healthier because by making their own food they will be more aware of what they are eating.\nDYI Classes\n\"Do it yourself\" classes improve practical skills. As most college students will soon leave for university and will live in dorms, without their parents, they are oblidged to solve malfunctions by themselves. The information they acquired during these courses will help them for the rest of their lives. \nCitizenship classes\nAnother kind of classes that are necessary are citizenship classes as teenagers nowadays are deficient in this field. These courses will develop the civic sense of students and they will start involving actively in society.\nConclusion\nThe overall purpose of these actions is to keep young adults in school and to educate them. The Education Authority believes that social problems are linked with a decrease in participation in extra- curricular activities and it suggests that the college should use extra funding to solve this issue. Organising clubs and courses such as the ones mentioned above would ensure the improvement of the situation.",

  "text": "Today, I’d like to share with you a small but historic story, also together with my own view on it. I hope you would like it.\nIn the historical river, there was a dynasty called Jin, during which this story took place. A little boy called Lucky Wang, however, was not so lucky as his name suggested. In his early age, he lost his mother to illness. As a result, in order to be sure that he could get the same love from mother like other children, his father married another woman. On the contrary ,the fact was inconsistent with what he expected. Lucky Wang’s stepmother was such a snake-hearted woman that she did as many cruel things as she could to torture this poor boy. One day in an especially chilly winter, Lucky Wang’s stepmother got sick suddenly. Not concerning the harsh environment but her own appetite, she commanded Lucky Wang make a delicious meal with fresh fish. In desperation, he stepped to the river bank. Seeing the frozen water surface, he could do nothing but cry. As time flew, the sun sank little by little, which made Lucky Wang feel more and more helpless. So depressed was Lucky Wang that he simply lay on the ice with weeping. It was exactly when he was hesitating whether went home to face the beatings from his stepmother or not that two craps leaped up out of the ice and flopped onto the bank in front of him. Surprised and delighted, the boy took the fish home and prepare delicious fish soup for his stepmother. Moved by this little boy’s filial devotion, his stepmother changed her attitude and started to love him from her deep heart. Ever since then, what filled this family is just happiness and love.\nAfter listening to the small story, some people were deeply moved by the happy ending, however, others thought it was unrealistic. No matter what the fact was, or even it never happened, the story just wanted to emphasize the importance of Filial Piety. Even if it was a fiction, the goal to make all the people in the society be filial could also be achieved, which would keep the society harmonious as well as orderly for a long time. Also, it was the governors’ terminal purpose. Only through this cultural education combined with other ways, could they keep their government generation by generation as they expected.\n",

However, sometimes, when I am thinking about my future, it is hard to imagine what is waiting for me. I want to live to a ripe old age, but at the same time I am afraid of it.\nOur society is becoming an increasingly elderly one. It is in fashion to have a small family, but have you ever thought about problems it may cause? The greatest one is the burden of financing care. At this day and age it is falling on the taxpayers. It does not boost their confidence in future perspectives. We often hear than no obstacle is ever insurmountable, however, is it true?  Sooner or later we will face the music. Only in that moment we will understand that we are one of the millions pensioners who need a lot of different services to live as fulfilled and independent life as we deserve. \nWe cannot rob Peter to pay Paul. The taxpayers try not to go against the establishment. They help our ageing population, but we should make some new reforms to subsidise the shortfall in our budget. Otherwise, this situation will have a detrimental effect on the taxpayers.\nFirst of all, it will be a good idea to encourage young people to start saving money as soon as possible. In such a way they can remain alert and no matter what will happen. Yesterdays’ petrified men will become confident. \nSecondly, the state can take 5 percent from every salary. The pensioners will receive their money when they retire. It will be long-lasting benefit for both parts. Our state will have a large sum of money which is an invaluable source. On the other hand the pensioners will be sure in their future.\nThe crux of the matter is to start these reforms now. The law of the jungle is not appropriate here. Everyone should think not just about his benefit, but about others. We cannot make a killing immediately. However, step by step we will work our way up. ",

You can relax when you are travelling, listening music or reading a book. Finally, travelling by public transport is generally cheaper than travelling by car. Maybe you spend more hours than travelling by car but I think it worth it, because you can save money.

It takes a higher level of creativity and spontaneity to succeed in it than your usual basketball match, since its flexible rules, no-coach system, intensified relationship between the player and the crowd, and reduced number of participants widen and complexify its field of possible actions. The 'style' factor of it (or \"aesthetic value\" if you will) also plays an important role, again, intensifying the relationship between team and the crowd while granting the pleasure of contemplating and executing flowing movement sequences, finishing a play, or just stylishly mocking your opponent. Not to mention the socially bonding ability of it, while on game tension between the opposing teams is somewhat inevitable, the irreverent, human, no strings attached nature of streetball events always compensate its negative aspects (which, upon closer inspection, reveal to be shared between every single sports event).

Researchers have claimed that new generations are likely to suffer from more diseases. But is it really so?\n\nFirstly, teenagers today eat lots of junk food, which is definitely harmful,as it leads to obesity (Summerfield, 2013). Moreover, they often smoke and drink alcohol, which produces serious physical and mental diseases (CasaColumbia, 2007). Furthermore, teenagers have changed their life styles and now they are generally sedentary, since they use their computers or watch TV all day long instead of doing sports. \nNevertheless, governments claim that they nowadays are more aware of the importance of health than in the past. For instance, in Chile the programme Elige Vivir Sano tries to improve the eating habits of young people in educational institutions, where fun activities are promoted to students by integrating healthy living ( Elige Vivir Sano, 2012).\n\nLastly, everyone must understand that good health is above wealth.Parents and children should be informed about the use of drugs and junk food consumption, in order to raise awareness and improve their quality of life.\n",

  "text": "Public transport has been improved to such an extent that nowadays it is probably competing with private transport. Although we can choose more destinations and it is more comfortable, prices are not competitive enough to definitely substitute the car.\nAmong all the means of transport, the train has become the most important public transport for short and middle distances. Without a doubt, long distance journeys are best carried out by plane. When considering the bus, users feel that it does not offer any advantages compared to the car and it is taken when no other option is possible.\nAs I see it, drivers really appreciate the freedom of choosing their destination, the time to leave or to arrive, even the people to go with. If not, they would not make the investment of a car, pay its maintenance cost and fuel. Indeed, the public transport cost for the same journey done by car hardly recovers the amount invested.    \nMore and more, the oil shortage makes prices for fuel increase so does for transport; economic policy of importing countries tend to establish saving measures in order to be strategically less dependent. Moreover, considering pollution, private transport seems to be much more difficult to manage because it is an individual decision. In the near future, this fact will be seriously taken into account by governments.\nTo sum up, future generations will have to face the challenge of a sustainable world and surely public transport will play an important role.

  "text": "Chic & Creative Dessert Lounge \n\nATUM Desserant is an awesome dessert lounge on 16/F in the new L Square building in Causeway Bay! I found out about this new shop from friends and pictures online so I decided to come check it out for myself. As I had arrived just as they open at 1pm, I had the whole place to myself. The majority of the space was taken up by a U shape marble counter where customers can sit and observe their desserts being made. Several lounge sofas were available on the side for big groups to sit together, but the view was what caught my eye as the floor-to-ceiling windows let in a vast amount of natural light. The patio is probably a bit narrow to place tables outside but people can go out and enjoy the view when the weather is cooler. The decor was very simple and chic with abstract paintings hanging on the wall which would allude to the style of desserts being served here.\n\nI started chatting with the chef who told me that he wanted to start a dessert lounge for people to relax and enjoy desserts. He felt that a lot of places out there tend to make the experience too rush where you have to line up for an hour and finish eating in like 20 minutes before they kick you out. There are currently 9 desserts offered on the menu with prices ranging from $108 to $138 while there is also the famous Improvisation dessert for 2 at $328. I couldn't decide what to get at first because they all sounded so interesting so I asked the chef for recommendations. He recommended the Bamboo Charcoal as the theme is chocolate which was perfect for me!\n\nEach dessert comes with some appetizers to cleanse our palate. The test tube contained watermelon juice with sea salt which was very refreshing to drink in the summer heat. The salt brought out the sweetness of the watermelon while working as a balancing agent so the juice would not be too sweet. I was told that the drink/soup changes frequently depending on what would be suitable at the moment. \nBamboo Charcoal ($138) - I got to watch the chef as he prepared my dessert at the counter and I was getting more and more excited to taste his artful presentation as it came to life! It literally looked like a piece of abstract art painting. This was a chocolate theme dessert with bamboo charcoal ice cream, chocolate ice marshmallow, chocolate caviar and raspberry sorbet. I didn't know what charcoal ice cream would taste like but it was actually chocolate mixed with a bit of charcoal. The chocolate flavor was rich but not too sweet while the raspberry sorbet was delightfully tart and tangy. My surprise favorite was the microwave sponge cake that the chef added at the last minute. He told me that this is a new method of making sponge cake in the microwave that results in very fluffy texture which would be hard to achieve in a traditional oven due to temperature constraint and timing. It was very light and fluffy while still full of flavor!\n\nThe dessert also came with a choice of coffee or tea so I opted for the Lime Flower & Lavender Tea at their recommendation as well. My tea was brought out with teapot and a small hourglass timer where I am supposed to wait 3 minutes before I should pour the tea. The smell was wondrous from the lavender while the flavor was almost mint-like and refreshing to drink. They also offered me some honey to add into my tea when I thought it wasn't flavorful enough at first.\nVerdict - I was very impressed with the desserts at ATUM Desserant as they were delightful for both the eyes and the mouth! It would be perfect if they served alcohol as well and they told me that they are in talks with the building management to do so.

  "text": "As the days go by, more discoveries are being unearthed in a rapid pace. The major thing I imagine will be found in the next 50 years is magic. Some advantages are given in the following passage. For example, we will be able to travel through time. Imagine looking at Shakespeare in his English class, Einstein in his first science class and Picasso picking up his paintbrush for the very first time. We will not only witness all of the greatest moments in time but also correct the mistakes we make.\nNonetheless, there are some disadvantages. If a person possesses the magic power that is too powerful for others to defend themselves from, he or she can basically rule the world. Additionally, terrible wars will break out if one side of the magic possessors get greedy and try to take away other people's powers. In the end, the discovery of new things can never come to an end. Thus, we should prepare ourselves for whatever is coming in the future. ",

But still, our customs had evovled a lot. Due to the geographicall conditions where Japan is located aside Pacific Ocean, people here are adapted to eat raw fish and would like to put it as a main dish to serve customers in most restaurants. Unfortunately, I don't like eating raw foods, especially for under-cooked fish. It makes me arouse a feeling of nausea.So , I can only have cup noodle for those nights when I leave school at 8:00 p.m.\n\nApart from the eating culture, everything is going well as people here are generous and hospitable. My host family take me to different hot spots and teach me how to speak Japanese, in order to facilitate the\n progress of integrating to their culture. Last week, we went to The Mountain Fuji. The mountain was half-melted with glacier on top. That was magnificent and mind-blowing.

  "text": "Scuba diving obviously is one of the most exciting and thrilling sports on earth. Who does not want to feel like an astronaut on our own planet exploring the magical underwater world just on a recreational trip?  I surely embrace the fact that the diving community has recently been exploding with many new enthusiast members, not only bringing a unique experience into your life, but also enhancing awareness about environmental conservation issues towards a broad public.\nThe downside of this is that hordes of eager newly  trained divers populate the underwater world, often with little clue of the life-threatening risks that they are facing. I am writing this letter as a wake up call to those who think that their recently earned certification gives them the skills to go out diving wherever they want. How thoughtless is that ? From my point of view it should rather be seen as a license to learn. \nConsequently I see a pretty massive responsibility for the instructors and dive masters in telling the newcomers about the risks of their sport.  To my great astonishment I witnessed a completely different pattern of behaviour time and again. I saw  dive-buddy's and even professional dive masters  pushing and stimulating  fresh divers to extend their limits in order to dive to that spectacular wreck or enter that mysterious cave when they simply do not have the appropriate training for it.  Unbelievable !  \nPlease,  let everybody take their own responsibility !  You can imagine that it is really traumatic for divers when they encounter a corpse in the water, not to mention the  great distress such a disaster gives to the family that was left behind.  \nThe bottom line is :  get as much out of your diving experiences as you can, but stay safely within your own boundaries set by your personal education and practice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "The scope of this report is to give readers an overview in the historical development of water treatment, the changing perception of standardization of water treatment, and the continuous improvement of the technologies that are involved due to the growing lists of water quality parameters to be monitored. This report is an introductory document meant for students interested in the field of water treatment.\n\nSupply of potable water is perhaps the most important part of all municipal services. Clean and adequate water supply system is vital aspect in public health and social prosperity. It is essential for all forms of life by which water participates in numerous biochemical reactions such as distribution of nutrients, removal of metabolic waste, and body temperature regulation. People depend on water for cooking, drinking, and other domestic purposes. Water treatment must meet requirements for public and industrial standards. In all cases, the treatment process must fulfill both quality and efficient use of resources.\n\nCHAPTER 2\nHISTORY OF WATER TREATMENT\n2.1\tWATER TREATMENT IN THE PAST\nMithen’s (2010) researches show that most ancient civilizations inaugurated themselves near water resources and successful civilizations were dependent upon delicate systems of water transport. Although an understanding of water quality was not well understood, the importance of water was apparent to our ancestors.\nGreek historian Diodorus Siculus, ca. 80-20 BC, wrote forty books of world history and in the translated version by Oldfather (1939), Siculus provided early documents of purifying water such as boiling and sand filtration, dating all the way back to 2000 BC in ancient Greek. Since microbiology was yet studied, people at that time could not distinguish between clean and polluted water. The main precaution measure was purely by judging turbidity of the water and this false practice had remained ever since, even nowadays. It took years for people to recognize that their sense of smell and vision were not reliable judges of water quality.\n\n \nFigure 1 A qunat at the National Library of Iran, Tehran (http://media-1.boo.britainica.com/eb-media/72/987654-004-03E63A41.jpg)\nThe development of qunats (Figure 1) began about 2500 years ago in Iran, a sloping tunnels drilled into the foot of a hill that contained groundwater. This ancient type of water supply system is still used in arid regions of the world. For example, in 1933 the capital city of Iran, Tehran, drew its entire water supply system using the same principle of qunats, though with a lot more complications added into it. These complications were primarily caused by pollution in the underground water which was previously unknown. Unlike the past, where people have little knowledge about sanitation and hygiene; with better scientific understanding and public education, people learn to think and evaluate the quality of the water that they are drinking and using every day.\n\n2.3 BREAKTHROUGHS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\nThe history of water treatment continued in 1670, as two Dutch glasses makers investigated on magnification glasses led to the invention of the microscope. This scientific discovery broken down the barrier and enables biologist to observe organism that were invisible to the naked eye (Figure 2). In 1676, Scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, \n",

The restaurants' slogan is \"positive eating\" and they definitely live out that phrase.\n\nThe large dining room with high ceiling is what catches everybody's eye, especially if you set your foot into the restaurant for the first time. There are no walls separating the foyer from the dining room or the kitchen from the guests. This being said, you can imagine the atmosphere being comfortably airy. Sitting at any table you can watch the chefs preparing the fresh food. Long wooden tables, which would be perfectly suitable for a class our size, are placed in the middle of the dining room. Assembled around those long tables, you will find the smaller tables and even a cosy lounge for people waiting for a free table.\n\nThe menu offers a wide range of mouth-watering thai-food dishes including starters, curries, noodles and desserts. Additionally, they offer a monthly alternating \"special menu\" card presenting five main courses. The food is always freshly prepared. The chefs take great care in selecting only the best quality food. They avoid using convenience food and any kind of artificial flavors. Definitely worth pointing out are the excellent fruit juices. Another aspect I would like to emphasise on is the service. The waiters go out of their ways'. They are courtous and industrious.\n\nThe restaurant offers good quality food for reasonable prices and the atmosphere is very welcoming. And as I know that my classmates prefer light and healthy food, I highly recommend going to the \"Chachas\" restaurant.",

  "text": "There has been substantial attention to writers’ self-presentation and identity in online social media recently; Boyed (2008) studied how teens present themselves online through Myspace site; Lee (2014:  92) reports that people illustrate a different identity in facebook through using “a different language and writing style”. He asserts that language choice and identity are not “predetermined” and are prone to change (Lee 2014:  91); their change is derived from the context where discourse is negotiated and how “interlocutors interpret the identities being projected” (ibid:  91). Therefore, context, including the participants, their social purpose, their means and channel of communication, plays a role in language choice and identity construction. Lee (2014:  92) refers to the “forms of participation\" in a social media and having the sense of audience in mind as the key elements that can possibly change “the way people think of themselves” that changes the way they present themselves and their identity online thereby. He refers to using nicknames, for example, as a way of self-expression that can shape the audience’s mind and interpretation of writers’ identity. \n\nLee (2014) defines three ways of self-presentations in most social media: (1) “online profile” (p. 97), that is the “entry point to social networking”. In Boyed’s terms, profile is an important space where writers tell the audience \"who they are and how they want to be seen\"; a link that connects people’s “offline and online identities\"(2008: 129).  Examining teens’ identity construction in social media, he states that profile is where teens “express salient aspects of their identity for others to see and interpret” (2008: 129); (2) “continuous status updating” that is updating about life and sharing experiences from the “first person” point of view and (3) “visual representation” that is “visual images” (p. 98)(emphasized as in original).  \n\nContinuous updating, as a way of self-presentation, is one of the features of blog writing by which blog-writers can share their emotional experiences and views with the audience.  If the weblog-writers prefer presenting the world from their own angle, through using the first person pronoun, or tell their stories through the readers’ eyes, by involving other grammatical subjects, is among the focuses of this study.  It seems that checking the Subject, as an interpersonal element in the clause, can provide evidence of my student-writers’ self-presentation and involvement in the discourse constructed in their blogs. This is also relevant to the notion of stance and position or the existence of author in the text.\n",

  "text": "It was a sunny day in Turin. The children were playing outside, old and new couples were enjoying their love and everything seemed to be absolutely bright. In the busy streets, a student was walking fast, apparently unaware of all this. Suddenly, he turned left and stopped, as if he didn't know what to do next. He then saw a young woman waving at him. A few minutes later, they were together in a bar.  Michael was still hurt. They had plans for the future before.. he thought he would have married her. And then severything had crashed.  Michael tried not to think about it and to listen instaed to what she was saying... Her voice was weak and fleble while she said \"..and I was really depressed, you know and then I thought... we always talked about going in India...and I thought...maybe we could fix everything..so..I'm just asking..will you go with India with me?\" She looked at him and he thought she was still beautiful.  He loved her and she was trying to get back with him, as he had hoped in the last months. But suddenly he thought he was really angry with her. \"I'm sorry, but I don't want to hear from you anymore\" he said, and then stood up and without watching her walked out of the bar. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. ",

  "text": "Dear Paul,\nThanks for your e-mail. I'm glad to hear that you are having a great time abroad volunteering for this international cultural organization. I think that it is a wonderful idea to collect different experiences before starting university studies. \nAs you know I spent last month in Eastern Europe working for a similar cultural organization and I have a hands-on experience in organising a cultural festival and particularly musical concert. I loved my job there and if I only had an opportunity to do it again, I definitely would. \nDuring my staying there I was responsible for taking care of musicians and contacting media. What I especially loved about my job there, was the opportunity to work in such a diverse group of people. I learned how to respond to different people's needs resulting from cultural differences and expectations. I also appreciated much the practical experience I could get there – how to organise job at the office so that everything goes smoothly and everyone gets what they want, how to use social media for advertising and promotion, how to communicate with press and television etc.\nI look forward to hearing from you soon and I hope that you'll find this experience as amazing as I did. All the best.\nXYZ\n",

  "text": "I agree with the statement.\n\nIt is known that gossip magazines are bought by lots of people who are interested in what these people do, the kind of clothes they wear or even the tattoos they have.\nIn fact, although they are famous, they are people too, which means that they should be free to do whatever they like in their free time. This happens because some people is famous just because they have had an affair with a singer or a footballer, so the only thing people want to know about them is if that is true or not, and when it happened. It would come to an end if society changed the concept of \"famous people\".\nIn the case of politicians, I don't mind what they do in their holdidays, for example, if they work properly when they have to.\n\nBut I think there is an exception: monarchy. I think Royal Family is an exception because they are supported by all the citizens,so I think we (as citizen) have the right to know eveything they do if we want. I mean, it would be better that there was more transparency as far as how they spend \"our money\" is concerned.\n\nI think journalists should follow famous people only when they do something related to their profession or the fact that has made them famous.\n\n",

But after a while he thought about something bigger, huge and more expensive. A house for them to live! Ken was not a small guy, short hair, sharp teeth and nose, light skin, blond hair and sky-blue eyes.\nThat day was the day, Elena's birthday, and Ken wasn't sure how to give that massive present when suddenly he had an excellent idea. He had already thought about that so he grabbed a blindfold and put it over Elena's eyes. When Elena took it off she was blown away, completely amazed with what she saw.\nIn front of her was a stunning house. It was enormous, with huge windows, white walls and with superb views of the sea and the shore. Elena couldn't be happier with the situation.

He chose a blue tie and a light grey suit. It took him twenty minutes to do his hair.

When he was totally satisfied with his look he turned on and off the light of his bedroom eight times. Michael always thought that this little ritual gave him an extra piece of luck. He went out of his little apartment and walked full of confidence to the bus stop. He thought happily that he was not only on his way to his new job but he was on his way to his new life.

You are listening to your favourite music. The temperature level is exactly what you like. And you never, ever, will contact with other people. Well, there can be some pretty girls among the passengers for sure, but it's far too often that you will have to sit near some stinky bum.\n\nMore than that, the car is always there when you need it. You have not wait till it arrives and it is never late. Your car will always go to the right place -- no transport changes, no awkward routes.\n\nBut -- will it always be the best choice? No, not at all! When you want to travel the world or just going to visit your parents, which are two thousand miles from you, it would be better to take a bus or a train. You won't be able to cover such a distance in one day. So in that case it's better to leave your car at home.\n\nAnd what if the car you're driving will break? Just imagine that you are sitting in the broken car, at night, without any sign of a car service for fifty miles around you! High cost of fuel will definitely be the lesser evil in this situation.\n\nSo I'd have to say this. On short distances, maybe one or two hundred miles, a car is ideal. But if you take a big journey alone, you'd better take an old good bus, just like 100 years ago.",

Public transport offers a range of timetables for trains, buses or metro, but when it comes to deal with the day-to-day tasks we very often find travelling by our own car it is the easiest way. For instance, travelling with children it is very annoying on public transport due to all the security issues involved. There is no easy way to carry our weekly shopping, stuff for the gym or instruments on public transport. \nWe try to steal minutes from every hour to find time to do all the things we want to do. Waiting at the bus station for our next bus after just roughly missing the last one, being stuck in the middle of a crowd trying to reach the same train as everyone else, doesn't make us life any easier at all.

Speaking of which, it wasn't easy. Dealing with other people is the hardest part, escpecially when they're the same age as you. I think I did my best. \nAnother good thing is that I had a chance to talk to journalists. They came from different parts of the world. There were people from Russia, Germany, Brasil. That was really great to meet them and to talk with them. By the way, do you know Jess Morrow? She's a journalist from the New York Times. She's very famous and I told her everything she wanted to know about the show.\nBefore the concert started, me and my co-workers had to clean the stage, set up the equipment and make sure everything works well: the sound, the lightning and the instruments. \nHelping at this concert was a hard work but very inspiring.

If you take the time to ask around, you'll find out that a lot of the most experienced sailors never took classes. \n\nSo the most important piece of advice I would give to everyone is: try,  \nand if the first time is not so good, try again: in different weather conditions, with different people, and different kind of boats. \nMaybe you will not get addicted to it as much as I am, but I'm sure you will have a great time, and in the worst case you will have the chance to meet wonderful people.

Our monthly fuel expenses can be reduced by using public transport to get to the workplace. Nowadays environmental pollution is also important that's why public transport should be promoted as environmentally friendly way of transport. Not always car is much more convenient, for example in a big city it is far more convenient to use underground than a car during the rush hour. When we use public transport we can read a newspaper or book and when we driving a car it's impossible. In my opinion nowadays driving a car is very stressful because of traffic intensity. Driving a car is also more tiring, driver must be concentrated all the time. Of course not always public transport is more convenient. When we want to go on a weekend trip to the countryside car is irreplecable for families with children or animals. Also go on holidays by car can be very comfortable. With car we are more independent than with public transport. There are many pros and cons but for sure we can't say that there is no future for public transport.",

The final section of this proposal makes some recommendations about what should be done to elevate the website aesthetic and improve user-friendliness.\n\nProblems with the current website\n\nA survey was conducted among the 200 people who filled the complaints. The majority of people were of opinion that the site was clunky and hard to use and nearly two thirds of the participants considered that the design needs to be modernised. Others problems cited included pretty low uptime of the website, connection issues and login problems, particularly correct credentials not working.\n\nWays to address the issues\n\nI think the website needs to be revamped to attract more users. The look and feel should follow the \"material design\" standards as they are defined by Google and should use more modern fonts. As for the server and database administrators, they should immediately resolve the issues regarding the backend part of the website.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI would like to make the following recommendations:\nImplement a tutorial to facilitate the usability for new users, and also make it possible to retake the tutorial as per user request.\nConduct a survey on a minimum of one thousand people on what features should the website include.\nDevelop a better feedback system so users can express their concerns and questions in a more detailed way.\n\nI assure you that if these recommendations are implemented, the website will improve significantly.\n",

She had just got the job and she wanted to show what her skills were.No one could have imagined that she was such a brilliant person and when she gave the article to the boss the latter was quite astonished. The next days the boss ordered her to write an article about the natural beauties of Colombia, a little State located in South America. So she left on Monday and she landed in Bogotà Tuesday. Never had she seen such a high waterfall. She used to live in a flat so she had never disovered how much the world was different and beautiful. That evening she met with a local guide she was invited to taste the local food and to dance with the traditional clothes of that friendly civilization. The following day she came back to London where all her family was waiting for her since they werevery curious about the weird Alison's trip.",

  "text": "Sport is probably as old as humanity itself. All over the world people of different ages are very fond of sport and games. Sport not only helps people to become strong and to develop physically but also makes them more organized and better disciplined in their daily activities. Sport helps people to keep in good health.  Needless to say that sport plays a very important role in our life. It gives us much pleasure and many moments of joy. It’s popular among young and old people. Many people do morning exercises, jog in the morning, train themselves in fitness clubs and gyms, and take part in sports competitions. Other people like sports too, but they only watch sports competitions, listen to sports news. They prefer reading interesting articles about athletes and sport events, but they don’t go in for sports.\nThere are a lot of kinds of sports such as swimming, wrestling, cycling, box, football, hockey, track and field athletics and so on. There are summer and winter kinds of sports. The summer kinds of sports are, for example, swimming, athletics, football, volleyball, basketball and others. The winter kinds of sports are, for example, figure skating, skiing, ice hockey etc.\nAmong the popular sports in our country are football, basketball, swimming, volleyball, tennis, gymnastics, figure skating and others. You can choose a sport for any season and for any taste. I’d like to describe some of them. In spring and summer many people prefer to go in for jogging. This is very popular sport and very useful for your health. You slow run and enjoy the beauty of nature around.  This kind of sport is getting more and more popular over the world. If you go to Europe you can see a lot of people who go in for jogging.\nSpeaking about sport I can’t help saying about football, because this is very spectacular kind of sports. There are a lot of football teams, football events, and fan clubs in almost every country of the world. Some football players are world famous; they make excellent careers and take part in each championship. Football matches attract a lot of spectators, who come supporting their favorites. \nMany people today go in for extreme sports. Perhaps, they find ordinary sports too boring and unexciting. It is also known that extreme sports help to build character and form a strong personality. There are different types of extreme sports, for example, rock climbing, rafting, scuba diving, surfing, snowboarding, parachuting, hang-gliding, bungee jumping etc. These activities usually involve speed, height and a good level of physical training. However, they become more and more popular even among the beginners. Doing such sports people learn how to overcome difficult situations and how to survive in an emergency. It also develops patience and self-control, and helps to control your fear. More importantly, it gives the sense of achievement. \nLet’s consider some kinds of extreme sports. Take bungee jumping. You jump off a bridge and you fall and fall, and then, just before you hit the ground or water, an elastic rope pulls you back. In skysurfing you jump out of an airplane and use a board to “surf” the air, doing gymnastics in mid-air! Winter sports have always an element of danger. For example snowboarding, which has all the excitement of surfing but on snow, is more dangerous even than skiing. Ice diving is for those people who are absolutely crazy. You put on diving equipment and dive under a frozen lake. And, if that's not enough, you try to walk upside down on the ice!\nA lot of people are not fit nowadays. It's a big problem today. If you want to feel fit you'd better go in for one kind of sport or another. I think that everyone must do all to be healthy. Good health is better than the best medicine. To tell the truth I don't do sports regularly and it is not an essential part of my daily life. In summer I go swimming as there is a beautiful pond with pure water where my Granny lives. In winter I go in for skating. If I have free time I go to the nearest skating-rink with my friends and we have much pleasure, skating together. This kind of sport is very elegant. You should control your body very well if you wish to skate gracefully. I shouldn't call myself a sports fan. Of course, I watch sports competitions on TV from time to time, like swimming or running. I admire extreme kinds of sport. I think they are really cool. I admire people who dare to do such sports. \n",

  "text": "Television is  not an issue of general consensus. It is definitely a way of spending our free time. However, does it teach us something? Does it help us grow and improve our knowledge?\n\nOn the one hand, it is said to help people to spend quality time as they can learn about the most varied subjects from the comfort of their homes. It is possible to watch documentaries, the news, concerts, plays and learn about current affairs.\n\nOn the other hand, there are programmes which bring nothing new into our life. Therefore, one should not waste time watching tem. Violent programmes, reality shows and others alike have nothing to teach. In these cases, TV is undoubtedly bad entretainment.\n\nAll in all, it is my belief that if we use it properly, i.e., if we carefully choose what to see, television can have an important role to play in the learning process of everyone of us, and in particular, in the life of the ones who cannot afford travelling, buy books or live in an educated environment.\n",

  "text": "If you are looking for a film that provides you with suspense and action at the same time, I recomend you to watch \"Now you see me\". \nThe film, directed by Louis Leterrier, is about four magicians, known as \"The Four Horsemen\" that join together by a mysterious benefactor, and during their presentations they do all kind of illegal stuff, such as robbing a bank or ripping off their own boss. Because of them, there's an agent of the FBI, Dylan Rhodes, that persecute them through different states of EE.UU.\nThe characters in charge of the four magicians are Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco and Woody Harrelson. They are capable of making you think they really know how to illusion someone. Morgan Freeman is the best actor of all times and perfect for the role of developer tricks and helper of the FBI to catch the \"Four Horsemen\". Also there is no other better for the role of agent as Mark Ruffalo.\nBut it's not just the acting that it's great in the film. The shots of Las Vegas, New Orleans, Paris and New York are wonderful, and the fact that nothing is computerized at the time to witness the magic tricks it absolutely amazing.\nSo if you enjoy magic tricks, surprises, very handsome actors and splended actresses, why would you miss it?

  "text": "What I did not in Vacations\n\nDuring vacations I didn't enjoy my time because I didn't find out that I am a wizard. Also, aliens did not get me and practice surgery on me. Sadly, I couldn't meet Lady Gaga nor Justin Timberlake. I was very disappointed because I did not do any of these things during vacations.\n\nSince I didn't discover that I am, in fact, a wizard, I couldn't get a magic wand. I did not go to Hogwarts not turn my brother into a frog. Being normal gets old and not being a wizard is shabby.\n\nAs aliens didn't kidnap me I did not travel all around the galaxy during this vacations week. I did not see the planets nor meet any sexy alien girl from Saturn. Staying at home all day is regrettable and not being kidnapped by aliens gets really boring.\n\n After not being a wizard nor kidnapped by aliens, I did not meet Lady Gaga in New York nor hang out with her and Justin Timberlake. We three counldn't sing together nor make laugh of Kim Kardashian. No one likes being \"unfamous\" and I don't like not being Lady Gaga's friend.\n\nIndeed, what I did in vacations was sleep the whole day, hang out with my \"Unfamous\" friends and write and compose two and a half songs. Watching \"as in heaven, in hell\" was hilarious although it is a horror movie. But, lets face it doing these things is not as wonderful as discovering magic powers, being kidnapped by aliens or singins a song with Justin Timberlake and Lady Gaga.\n",

It will be our third time at this campsite. Even though it is a large campsite it feels small and cosy. The campsite borders on a small lake which can be quite cold, even in summer. However, we usually do not let this stop us from going into the water. We like to visit the cities and various sights in the area. One of the sights we definitely want to see is the former border between West-Germany and East-Germany. We also like hiking and are planning on doing that a couple of times per week. The region where we will stay has a nice system that encourages people to hike. At some point during your hikes you can collect stamps in a special booklet. For somewhat younger children this is a nice incentive to participate in these hikes. Some hikes are short, but steep and some hikes are long and involves no climbing at all. We will probably stay at this campsite for about three weeks and besides the hiking we will read and laze about.",

  "text": "Hello! My name's Vanesa, I'm 33 and I really enjoy watching soap operas. These days I watch a lot of different soap operas, though my favourite one is -and will always be- Friends. The plot is about six young people (they`re about 26): Ross, Rachel, Monica, Chandler, Joey & Phoebe. They live in New York City and have a lot of comical and romantic adventures, all of them related to their friendship.\n\nWhat could I say about the characters? Well, Ross is a paleontologist that works in the Natural History Museum, and he's Monica's older brother. Monica works as the main chef in a restaurant situated in Manhattan, she is Rachel's best friend since high school and she longs for a boyfriend (she finally marries Chandler). Chandler is the funny guy and he works as a stock agent. Rachel has always been daddy's little girl but, when she brakes her engagement at the beginning of the soap opera, she loses all her money and has to work as a waitress in a cafe (though she gets a job related to fashion world after a few years). Joey is... well, he's Joey: not so clever, a great one for the girls and -the most important- Chandler's best friend. And finally we have Phoebe, a veggie and bohemian girl who enjoys singing and playing the guitar and who works as a massage therapist.\n\nThe most interesting thing of 'Friends', in my opinion, is the love story between Ross and Rachel: the plot starts when Rachel comes to live with Monica in her apartment and Ross falls in love with her. This story continues until the end of the soap opera, when Ross and Rachel finally have a child (Emma). But there are a lot of funny stories, like Phoebe having  her stepbrother's children, or Joey becoming a great soap opera actor.\n\nI recommend 'Friends' to everyone. I think it's the best soap opera ever made.",

  "text": "Feeble souls\nMost people love donating money to different charities, but have you ever thought why it gives us such pleasure? I believe it’s because, as humans, when we see someone happy, it makes us happy, especially if we are the reason for that happiness. The problem is choosing who to donate to. Is it the poor, homeless children in your country or the starving people in Africa, or is it some cancer organizations? I choose none of the above.\n\tI've never understood why most people see a closed set of charitable organizations to choose from when they want to donate money. In other words, they choose only from the most common causes. When I think about donating money I see sick children and adults with rare diseases, and small groups of scientists and doctors doing their best to help them, but who don’t have enough money for research. I choose them because I know that they are the least people who get help - because how would people help them if they don’t know about them?\n\tFirst thing I’d do if I want to make a donation is go on the internet, and search Google for rare diseases. Then I’ll look for the diseases which the scientists are currently working on finding their cure. I’ll be left with a lot to choose from, so I’ll see which illness is the hardest to endure and choose this one to donate my money to.\n\tI have one of those unknown diseases, and I could easily donate to the doctors working on my illness, but I probably won’t. I know that there are a lot of other people with diseases that are way harder than my own, and they need a cure much more than I do. This makes me realize that even if I have a disease, as hard as it is, I’m still better than others and I’m grateful. I’m grateful I can bear my sickness and live with it, because others can’t.\n\t    To sum up, I believe more people should start donating to the uncommon charity organisations, to the ones who need more help. It would be sufficient to just see the smile on their face. We should all be thankful we are what we are, because we could be a lot worse. \n",

  "text": "According to Berkow (2004), Airway management is one component of anaesthesia procedure to ensure the patient airway is opened. An example of an intervention in airway management is the ventilation mask that Mr. Sharma was using. Also, this practice is the primary consideration for an efficient post anaesthesia care (Scoot, 2012).\nThe majority of patients that has had a general anaesthetic, as Mr. Sharma, must recover in a PACU (Post Anaesthesia Care Unit) to monitor the vital signs, specially the airways management due to the anaesthesia, impeding any postoperative complication (Scoot, 2012; Farrell & Dempsey, 2011). \nThe first 24 hours of post surgery, is considered the most critical period, because the patient can present, primarily, lung disorders, and the nurse need to maintain the cardio-respiratory stability (Popov & Peniche, 2009). \nAddressing the airway management after Mr. Sharma`s admission on PACU, the first procedure that the nurse should do, is follow the A-G assessment protocol, to review the stability and the airway patency of the patient, sustaining the pulmonary ventilation to prevent hypoxemia and hypercapnia  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Mr. Sharma’s airway should be spare and clean from mucus or blood (Pudner, 2010). Due to the surgery Mr Sharma is in supine position, but this position reduces his oxygenation (Snowball, 2012), and also can impede the air passage that is related to the anaesthesia effect, where the tongue and the lower jaw fall backward. Hence, he needs oxygen supply to prevent any airway obstruction. \nTherefore, the oxygen therapy needs to continue immediately along with his admission, via nasal cannula or oxygen mask within 4 to 6L/min, until the anaesthesia effects are completely gone and the patient’s oxygen saturation be restored  (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). Thus, Mr. Sharma is been given O2 via Hudson mask 6L/min, because he received general anaesthesia and all of his muscles are relaxed and at the moment he do not have control over his reflexes (Farrell & Dempsey, 2010). To help in this issue, the nurse should certificate that Mr. Sharma is confortable, and elevate the head of the bed for a more upright position in order to facilitate and increase his oxygenation, helping him to recover faster his respiratory instability (Snowball, 2012).\n",

I think it is a wrong way of thinking of sports. Therefore, I am going to explain the advantages of walking.\n\nI would like to start saying it is free. This could be seen as something minor, but being able to do the sport you love without paying is an incredible advantage. Secondly, I love its freedom; no pun intended. You can walk whenever and wherever you like. That is priceless. Thirdly, walking gives you a longer life expectancy. There are a lot of studies that prove this. Last but not least, you do not need any kind of special equipment or people. You can go walking alone and without shoes if you please.\n\nNevertheless, you learn a lot of things about any sport once you start doing it. Therefore, I would like to share some things with you. You can start walking as you like, despite that, you should wear comfortable clothes and shoes. The reason is that, the longer you walk, the more you will feel what you are wearing. The second advice is you should try to find the best places to walk around you. The sightseeing is very important once you start walking. \n\nI hope I have convinced all of you to go walking. I am a true believer in walking. Do not forget to greet me when we met on the road.\n",

  "text": "All students are different in terms of their cognitive styles, learning levels and achievements as well as motivation, personality, and pace of learning. When there are students with varied levels in English, it may be challenging for teachers to prepare for or deliver the course. Here are some of my solutions for this issue. First of all, determining the needs of the students is always the top priority. While conducting a need analysis, you can have a general picture of learners’ motivation in learning English. After that, teachers are supposed to use partnership and grouping exercises and activities in order to meet individual’s needs. Through teamwork, students with varied levels can cooperate and learn from each other through discussions. It is beneficial for both the upper and lower achiever because they can assist or get help from each other. Differentiated instructions, giving different tasks for the same activity, are proved to be necessary in a class with varied levels of students. Teachers can assign tasks which have different levels of difficulty, or different numbers of tasks to students with different levels. Moreover, instead of using a core textbook, or using different levels of textbooks, carrying out a theme-based approach is more appropriate, and it also saves teachers’ preparation time. Finally, preparing supplementary for both the upper or lower level of students, so that the higher achievers can stay excited and challenged, while the lower achiever can also learn by their own pace of learning. \n",

  "text": "Young people in Ukraine are more comprehensively developed than young people in USSR. Now youngsters have open access to knowledge and information through the Internet. Students have more opportunities to learn languages, discover foreign experience, pass internships and study abroad.  The number of Ukrainian students who study abroad increases every year. Our generation is more developed and diverse in spheres of modern culture, including arts, music, literature etc. The most valuable thing is that there are so many supporters of different trends in all these areas. \nIn Ukraine young people are different too. Some people prefer one style of music, some – another. That’s why it’s difficult to define one general style for the generation. \nDiscussing music styles, people in my country prefer pop and rock. We can define it by list of TOP music charters on music channels. There are a lot of Ukrainian executives. It’s necessary to emphasize that Ukrainian music has changed a lot from the time of Independence and now is developed very fast. \nIf we speak about TV programs, Ukrainian youngsters like popular American and Russian serials, like the Theory of big bang, Suits, Breaking bad, the Game of thrones, the Kitchen and so on. I must admit that some representatives of Ukrainian youth watch too many serials and waste a lot of their time. I think this problem is typical for almost all countries.\nIn clothes, youngsters prefer to wear famous fashion brands. Many people follow fashion designers. It’s interesting to admit that there is fashion on Ukrainian traditional clothes “vishyvanka” now. \nI hope after reading of my report you will have some minimal understanding of Ukrainian reality. Also I encourage you to visit Ukraine and to see its sightseens, to feel culture and speak to nice people!  \n    \n",

My town has got a lot of little villages around it, and it's very difficult to create a public transport service, because there are long distances between the different places, and there are not enough people to make it profitable. If you want to go to Vigo or other city which is near, the coach service is a good and not too expensive option. The coaches are slow, so most of the people prefer the car. If your destiny is further away, another good option is to travel by train. We have got a small train station in Tui, so we can go to a lot of places by train. Train is more expensive, but at the same time, it is more comfortable. So I think that creating a small bus line between the villages will help a lot of people, especially the older ones.",

As a country with one of the longest coastline in the world, I definitely would recommend you to know the beautiful beaches we have. I would also recommend you to know the city of Rio de Janeiro, there you will find beautiful beaches, wonderful weather and the wonders of nature in a modern and international city. You will be amazed by \"Cristo Redentor\" and \"Corcovado\", I have no words to explain how beauty they are. Another very good option is exploring Brazil's Northeast, as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro is.\n\nAbout working, I think you have a great chance to find an opportunity to work in one of many multinational companies we have in Brazil. Most of the biggest American companies are in Brazil for a long time and as an English native speaker it will be easier to you to find and internship. The nine months that you will spend travelling around Brazil will give you a better understanding of Portuguese and that will be an advantage to you find a new job here.\n\nI have many tips to share with you, I'll be glad to do it in person when you arrive.

It was really exhausting, but illuminating experience. \nIt was a charity concert, the income of which was intended for children who suffer from cancer. The main task of the volunteers was to collect money. I sold tickets before the concert, and then, during the concert, I helped take care of security. It was a truly amazing event. We tried to make everyone had fun. There were many visitors from other countries, so we often had to translate the conversation and help in communication. Everything was new to me and very exciting. But the most memorable was a meeting with the stars of the concert. They are really great people who want to help others, without pay.\nApart from that, everything's fine here in Poland. Don't forget that you're always welcome to come and stay- I'd love to see you, and we can take part in a similar event, as a volunteer, together. \nAnyway, I must go now. Write soon and tell me how you're getting on.\nLots of Love.\nJane.",

Even if there are a lot of variants, I prefer classical ballet.\nSince I was a child I wanted to learn how ballerinas could dance so graciously. On the other hand, I always loved classical music. For me it was the perfect combination. Luckily, we got a word of a dancing school. That, by chance, happen to be near my town. I spent four years doing one of the things I love the most, dancing. Sadly, things don't always work out the way we expect. Just as my enthusiasm for ballet thrived, my grades in school kept falling. Consequently, I had to leave.\nThere are some things you should take into consideration if you want to try this sport. Ballet requires a lot of time and effort. It's not only a physical sport, you really need to get your mind into it. Furthermore, ballet is expensive. Supposing that this type of dance isn't a tradition in your country, prepare to open your wallet. ",

Also, Ss were writing the sentences individually in their notebook instead of choosing only one person to write for the whole team. I actually had to stop the whole class and ask them to nominate one person to write for the whole group. I also noticed that one team is not writing anything. When I approached them, they said they can't remember the exact words that were dictated. Another team used the words to make sentences that are unrelated to the story. Ss could hardly hear each other well because of the rectangular layout of the room. The chairs were placed in a U shape which made it difficult for team members to discuss their ideas and to maintain eye contact. Additionally, one team had finished reconstructing their story while other teams needed more time to finish the task . I forgot to prepare extra materials for fast finishers.

Given the learning experiences in the past two year’s school-based support, some sound teaching strategies have been developed and these include the provision of adequate language inputs, ELPS and Thinking Tools. All of the above have been taken a good progress in developing P.1-4 school-based mathematics curriculum while there is still an area for developing in P.5 & 6 mathematics curriculum.  In view of these favourable conditions, higher expectations could be set to improve the learning progress and enhance the learning performance of NCS. The improvement of TSA results and internal results celebrated the success of teachers’ efforts. More collaborative efforts should be paid to make use of the sound teaching strategies with the aim of improving the learning performance of NCS. \n\n5.2.\tSustaining capacity building through CLP\nGiven the experiences gained in the support services, many mathematics teachers have been equipped with necessary skills in identifying the learning needs of students and developing effective strategies for teaching NCS. The school could consider stepping up collaborative efforts in developing coherence in curriculum development. The CLP could be further adopted as a vehicle to identify the learning needs of students and to build capacity of teachers. More professional opportunities could be purposefully arranged to explore some effective strategies and promote discussion among teachers. Sharing among teachers could be encouraged to understand the learning of NCS. \n",

The research done in this field has provided new mechanisms that  give the impression of being an alternative to yield the necessary amount of crops for humans,unfortunately, there is no evidence of GMC’s being completely safe for human consumption.\n\n It might be a cause of concern that all the research done has been under the command of private corporations that deny full access to experiment reports, leaving a cluster of questions without any answer. Companies as Monsanto that engineers plants with steeril seeds,  encourage non-sustainable production models that promote the extinction of  independent farmers who have to choose between their lifestyle and the new farming era.\n\nAccording to an article published by UNAM in 2001, the introduction of GMC’s has had a huge impact on the global market. The Monopolistic and monopsonic features shown in GMC companies establish that the research done in this field has nothing to do either with science or with technology and even less with the global food security.\n\nThe usage of genetically modified crops has proven to be dangerous for humans as well as for the environment. In their quest for the perfect seed, genetic engineers have strengthened crops that are destroying the seeds biodiversity, as stand by a research led by Greenpeace, GMC crops are threatening to human health because they present more toxic traces than non-modified crops.\n\nConsequently, we must be careful with the decisions we make.

Besides, avoiding the dubbing process, episodes can be seen in concert with their original airing.\n\nImpact on local culture\nAlthough the importation of such programmes has produced positive effects, such as the introduction of new perspectives on different aspects of life, it has also produced negative outcomes. Italian companies must face the challenge set by the market demand due to the importation of many foreign traditions.\n\nRecommendations\nIt is highly recommended that the government should provide adequate financial support to traditional small businesses. I would therefore suggest that local products be protected and valorised, to be able to reply to the threat represented by low price imported ones.",

I totally agree with this statement and, to my mind, people should travel a lot because our world is incredible. But there is one more question: travel by car or public transport? \nFirst of all, of course, travelling by car is much more convenient than, for example, by bus. You can drive wherever and whenever you want. Even just in cities, let it alone travelling at long distances. But, on the other hand, traffic jam or bad weather can make our trip inconvenient. Moreover, there are not many parking places in big cities.\nSecondly, travelling by public transport is much cheaper. Not all people can afford travelling by car every day so they choose public transport. \nThirdly, we should take care of our environment! Cars pollute our air what leads to many diseases such as asthma, allergy and even cancer. Moreover, cars release poisonous exhaust fumes and chemicals into the air, which mix with the water in the clouds, and the polluted rain, which later falls, damages trees, lakes and buildings.\nSo, my advice is to travel by bicycle (at least, use public transport) because it is environmentally friendly!",

  "text": "Summary of the article “Business à la française” which was written by Simon Kuper.\nBy Arno Brodeur, student number 1234567, class ABCD1EF.\n\nThe difference in work meetings between the British and France are that the British want to make decisions and the France way more like a debate, as is written in a guide for Franco-British business relationships.\nThe opinion of Simon Kuper is that the main reason for the misunderstandings are different languages. This in contrast to the guide “Light at the End of the Tunnel: Practical Reflections on the French and British in Business” published by the French chamber of commerce in Great Britain.\nThe by the UK’s Foreign Office in 1944 published booklet “instructions for British Serviceman in France” is still useful for the most, nowadays.\nThe late actor Louis de Funès is mentioned as a role model by the chamber of commerce’s guide.\nWhen you get hired by a British employer it will be because of your experience or achievements as a leader in sports. In France the level of education is the main reason for hiring someone.\nBritish doesn’t speak out what they are thinking, in contrast to the Dutch.\nThe chamber’s guide was written by business men and women who were familiar with the habits of both countries. Something to remember is that people allow each other their own national habits, up to a certain point.\nIn 1995 the French came to notice that their languish wasn’t enough for doing business worldwide. This is one of the reasons why most French under 50 doesn’t speak English very well.\nInternational relationships are built by people who can speak the same languish and who are at the same level of their vocabulary.\nThe native speakers seek each other out, the British come together with the Americans and the French well…they are on their own.\nIf the French and British spoke the same languish evenly, the trade would go up by 44 per cent.\nIt’s no use to teach French on schools, because the French only except near native speakers. It’s better to talk British and force it on them.\n",

Volunteer work provides an organization with free resources to help it achieve goals. In many cases, volunteers are crucial to help maintain life, as when meals are delivered to homebound people. Sometimes volunteer work, such as renovating a playground, benefits the broader community.

  "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this report is to examine the possibility of hosting the European football championship in my country. This report outlines the benefits and the possible objections.\n\nLocation\n\nAs a matter of fact Budapest, the capital city of Hungary can be a very good competitor for hosting this sporting event. The river Danube divides Budapest into two parts. Margit Island is a favourite destination for runners and lovers. The island boasts fresh air and clear parks. Buda castle is an impressive ancient picturesque building and attractive tourist location.\n\nTransportation system\nRegardless of the mode of transport, fares are very affordable. The transportation system is effective. The obsolete trams and trolleys had been replaced. The underground system can ease congestion. Bicycle trails can criss-cross the city. You can rent bikes.\n\nFacilities\n\n1.) Puskás Ferenc stadium has ample seats for the spectators. It is suitable for 68976 people.\n2.) Airport Hotel is the most adjacent accommodation to the Liszt Ferenc airport. This inexpensive hotel has 112 rooms.\n3.) Le Meridien is set in the city’s fashionable business hub. The luxurious hotel has 218 rooms.\n\nCultural Life\n\nThe flourishing cultural life will fascinate visitors. The admission’s tickets to the most of Budapest’s museums are comparatively cheap. I recommend the Hungarian National Museum.\n\nObjections\n\nThe main concern is related to petty crime, especially the pickpocketing.\nIn addition, the homeless people have to sleep in the street. \n\nSuggestions\n\nOld historical buildings are in disrepair. The government should renovate the buildings which would be a great shelter for homeless people. The police chief should reinforce their patrol officers to tackle the crime. In conclusion it would be a good idea and a viable way through sponsorships. Moreover, this would be advantageous both for hosting city and the tourists.\n",

They say that the Earth's population will need to find and colonise two planets as our forests and fresh water supplies will vanish.\nOf course, all of this is unrealistic. It'll be impossible for people to live on other planets in 50 years' time. Technology won't have been advanced enough by that time.\nBut it's not entirely impossible. There is a little truth and possibility in it. In 50 years' time, maybe not all of the natural resources will have been used up, but most of it then will have been exploited. Mankind will have found other energy sources, similar to wind powered energy, solar energy and water powered energy. Maybe they will be using atoms or hydrogen, since hydrogen is all around us and it's very powerful.\nI'm completely sure that 50 years from now we will still be living on Earth, although our life styles will have changed a lot.",

  "text": "Many young students who have finished their secondary education wonder whether they should take a year off before they  make the most important decision about which university course they find suitable for their future. So, is it really worth it getting away from it all and setting off on a journey around the world or taking their first job?\n\nOn the one hand, there are many students who strongly believe that having a break for quite a long time is a waste of time. Firstly, most teenagers who are against this idea are convinced that the university course they have chosen will be the future career in their lives.\nMoreover, they feel they have to make the most of their time to become a university graduate and get a life in what they really love.\n\nConversely, there are many teenagers who need to take their time and see much of what the world has to offer them. Therefore, they choose a job that is related to a hobby or sport so that they can learn from and earn money at the same time. Others, by contrast, choose a country or trace an itinerary to travel to the place of their dreams and set off to live new experiences. \n\nTo my mind, gaining experience of any kind and taking a year gap before plunging into applying for a university course will broaden young people´s perspective to life and will help them become more confident with what they really love. Luckily enough, they may end up working in another country or their hobby could become their career. \n\n",

  "text": "People hold different views about the causes of crime. While some people argue that bad human nature is the reason, it is undeniable that social problems and indigence are responsible for the proliferation of wrongdoings.\nTo begin with, it is true that humans are often born with greed and selfishness. For example, it is not difficult to see the media talking about a son who kills his parents for money or a girl who is murdered by her boyfriend out of rage due to jealousy. These crimes may be committed by sensible people who are not able to control themselves  at crucial times. Thus, bad natural personality can be the seed of crime.\nOn the other hand, I would argue that poverty can be the major catalyst for illegality. It means that a number of law offenders cannot sustain their livelihood, and they desperately experience limited options to earn money. As a result, they are easily drawn by the allure of wealth, which leads to illegal  activities such as theft, kidnapping or drug trafficking. Big cities such as Hanoi or New Delhi witness a growth in juvenile delinquency which mostly stems from rural and underdeveloped areas. The proliferation of these crimes undoubtedly has a negative effect on the city’s life.\nIn addition, the prevalence of social media such as television or the internet is partially to blame. The effect of adult movies on the Internet can cause offence such as rape. Also, films and video games containing violent scenes can stimulate audiences to imitate those acts and commit crimes. This is particularly common among young people who are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality.\nIn conclusion, although human nature is likely to be a cause of crime, I hold the position that crime occur due to social media and poverty.\n",

Nowadays we are witnessing a shift in the role technology is playing in our society and may continue to play for generations to come. In the modern-day world technology is no longer a tool for survival but it turned to a means of communication and entertainment. Mass communication technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people. At the same time this raises the concern of whether technology has a good or bad influence on our society, is the use of technology destroying face-to-face interaction and communication between people?\n\nWhenever you’re in a coffee shop, standing at a bus stop or taking the tube you can easily see how people are connected to each other using different sorts of electronic devices. The primary concern regarding this new communication behavior is whether it made face-to-face interaction and communication between people nonexistent. This is true in many aspects as this may lead to living in a virtual world that only includes interacting with people with texting and social networks. This leads, among other things, to the ability for people to be lonely, as having too many virtual friendships causes the inability to establish meaningful relationships.

  "text": "Nowadays, society tends to prejudge others just because of their actions and without knowing the real motive of the behaviour. But with Colton’s quotation, we can clearly see that it has happened since years. I personally believe that imitation is just the sincerest form of admiration.  \nIn our current society we can see it daily. Lot of children got their hair cut as their favourite football players, others dress like their favourite actors and actresses or even adults act as their role model, just because they all do have something in common: they admire those people.\nFlattering is different, it is easier to recognize. If someone depends on you and s/he is constantly paying attention to you and being, in a colloquial way, a “brown nose”, you notice and become aware of it quickly. Just because of their attitude and aptitude, their behaviour… simply in the way they act, we can see their intentions. \nNowadays, in some determinate cases, people when they pretend to get a good position or be promoted, they flatter. And we can see these examples in many situations, when we find inept and incompetent workers. When acceding to these jobs is not through civil service exams, I think there are only two ways: influences or flattery; and to be honest I don’t know what I prefer.\nTo sum up, I would like to invite people who agree with the quotation, to rethink their opinion because everything is not what it seems to be.\n",

  "text": "I am really interested in martial arts, such as Aikido, Judo and self-defense that I have already practiced.  There are some that do not need too much forces and strengths, such as Thai chi and others that need more like Karate, Judo , and so. These kinds of sports have some advantages and disadvantages. \n\nthe First advantage of martial arts is to improve self-confidence. When you practise martial arts, you learn how to protect yourself against any sudden attack. You will get ready to fight with others, regardless their strengths, ages and so on. When you do a technique successfully on your opponent, you feel more confidence. Second advantage of doing martial arts is how to respect others. Every time, you do a technique  you have to show your respect to opponent, and also  other ranks, regardless to their age. Third one is movement and coordination between different parts of body; eyes, hands and legs. When you do a technique or defense against a technique, you control your body’s movement and coordinate them to work in the same time.\n\nSome people think there are some disadvantages like injury, and getting aggressive. According to studies, martial arts have fewer injuries than other sports like soccer. People who practise martial arts are less aggressive because they practice to control their inner energy, and also to respect.  \n\nI suggest that everyone should try martial sports. But before starting, you supposed to evaluate your needs and your health condition. And when you are starting, follow the discipline and find the ideas and thoughts that are hidden behind the movements and techniques. In the other words, try to understand the philosophy of the sports before learning the techniques.\n",

The exceptional play that we saw yesterday features all the iconic characters adapted to some extent adapted to the present time, such as, the White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, the blue caterpillar or the Queen of Hearts.\nOne of the biggest differences with the book is the atmosphere created on stage and the characterization of the characters.The only negative comment I could make is that you do not have the possibility to let your imagination in the same way that when you read the book.However, I strongly recommend going to see this play because it has a great appeal to both adults and children.

  "text": "Rationale:\n “Encourage learner autonomy – the teacher won’t always be there to provide answers” Alternatives to whole class feedback onestopenglish.\n\nThis lesson was the third trail of giving students written instructions and having them explain to the classmates what activities need to be done. This time in order to further reduce my TTT I handed over the correction of activities to the students as well. I hope by handing over the complete control to the class this would give them more chance to practice real world discussion and negation. techniques \n\n\nThe amount of talking done by the students was more that pleasing. They enjoyed being the“boss” and giving telling other students what to do.\n\nI had an exact copy of what the students had on their clue cards on a separate piece of paper this time rather than in the lesson plan its self. This made every thing seem less cluttered and more manageable. I highlighted anything that required an action from me on my copy of the clues e.g. handing a student the answers to an exercise.\n\n\nGiving the students the answers the exercises was a partially efficient way to encourage the students to speak more. I found that the class challenged the student who had the answers, if they had written down something different. I found that they challenged each other more than they ever do me. This method made the class lively and gave the students a chance to really defend their points of view. They used a lot of language that they would be able to use in everyday discussions (arguments) outside of the classroom. \n\n\n\n\nThis is the first time I have tired this method and I neglected to leave the students extra time to be able to benefit fully from the exercise. The enjoyed the exercise so much that my timing was completely off. I decided to cut an exercise in order to let the students continue their discussions.\n\nIn heinz sight giving this much control to the class and introducing a new and tricky grammar point (past modals) was not the best choice. \n\nInsights for future lessons:\n\nThe next time I do this lesson I would use a more skills based lesson with perhaps a listening or a short reading. If grammar was part of the lesson It would need to be a point that is being revised.\n      \nDespite having timing issues ,I feel that thus far this was the class with the most natural student participation and the lowest amount of TTT.         \n I throughly enjoyed the lesson and according to student feedback, so did they.

Inside it, we can find the well known sistine chapel, I can't tell you how it is, because last year when I went, there was a changeover of pope, and it was closed and I couldn't entry.

With any doubt a good friend is a treasure. Counting on someone capable of understanding your demands, who shares with you the  innermost feelings and who is able of discussing possible misunderstandings, is totally rewarding. As the saying goes \"A friend in need is a friend indeed\".\n\nNevertheless, a friendship depends largely on sincerity and empathy. If you respect your friends then they will respect you. In other words, no matter how far you live, a good friend will always support to you.\n\nCuriously, you never know where will you find a friend and every stage of your life brings you the opportunity to take advantage of new people who maybe attends to the same sport lessons than you or simply work in the same company. It is surprising the amount of nice people next to you sometimes, and it is a question of spending some time to realize that you have now new friends. \n\nAs I said before every moment in your life is different as your friends probably are too.",

On the one hand, I have been learning English for so long that my good profeciency have given me the chance to get a position in an international work team. On the other hand, I have learned French and Spanish just for a few months, because I was curious to learn the oficial language of the countries, where friends and relatives are living in. I am only able to read simple worksheets and to make a brief presentation about me.\nAs a student of these classes, especially, of English; I realized that, although the classes were important, a systematic language practice was essential for reaching an advanced level and, moreover, for maintaining it. Therefore, the hardest task of learning another language is to keep a high level of motivation to work on it and to pay for it.\nNevertheless, learning another language has many benefits, such as the ability in living and visiting countries with different languages, meeting foreign people, working in an international environment, reading books or websites in other languages, etc.\nThus, I suggest that everyone learn another language, in order to be a citizen, not of a country, but of the world.",

Actually, now I'm staying in New Zealand, but I can give you some advice about travelling and working in Korea. \n I think this is a very good experience to you because you can learn about another culture and people's way of thinking. So, I suggest you try to get a working holiday visa of Korea. If you have that visa, you can travel and also work. As you know, if you have normal tourism visa, you can't work. \n In Korea, we have many kinds of work which is related to English, so you can get a job easliy. Also, if you want to work more specific place such as electric company, public office and so on, you can apply to internship programme. If you get the intership, you can work as a real businessman. \n How long do you want to travel? Normally, summer is the best season for travelling. We have lots of beautiful beaches and mountains. In summer, you can enjoy many activities on the beach and also you can go hiking. Especially, I strongly recommend you go to Jeju Island. It is the most popular place that people want to go. \n So, now I have to go back to work. If you want to know more information about Korea, let me know and I don't mind checking your plan to go Korea.\n\nAll the best,\n\nYeeun",

Even now, as he stood in the doorway of this abandoned apartment building he knew that they may be hot on his trail.  With over two hundred thousand dollars in his bag he was a giant walking target.  He smiled, knowing that even the best laid plans crumble and was glad that he was taught to plan to police standards.  Peter began his slow dissent into the bowels of the building in front of him.  Ragged and worn, it certain had seen better days.  Graffiti covered the lower portions like a twisted skirt, doors missing, and windows gone.  His feet crunched on the unknown as he walked through the abandoned hallways.  Travelling farther down he found his destination, a small steep staircase covered in dust and shrouded in a mist like fog.  Peter's head jerked around as the first signs of his crime came to light.  A police officers car was zooming in his direction, sirens blaring.  Now running, Peter soon found himself on the top floor.  His panting turned into a magnificent grin as he looked out the window and saw a black helicopter heading in his direction.  Home free, he thought to himself. ",

  "text": "To begin with, I think that most people use their car to go to work and also when they go on holiday o to move themselves around the city or town because they feel free and don't have to pay attention to the timetable. Besides, public transport is very crowded with people at peak hours.\n\nBut, on the other hand, when they travel abroad, it's easier to take a train o a plane because you arrive faster and you needn't find a place to park your car and if you want to go somewhere you can take a taxi or a bus or even the underground.\n\nIn conclusion, from my point of view, if you are in your own  town or city, you use your car more often than when you are visiting another country and seeing the sights. Anyway, I don't think public transport has no future, but public transport is used on different occasions from before and when you go to a place you know you won't be able to find a place to park and you can´t waste time looking for where to park.\n\n",

While background color and art work are thoroughly considered, security issues are one thing that we cannot over look either. After this, metal plates need to be prepared by skilled machinists so as to proceed to bank notes printing, in which stage sheets are used to print (each containing 50 bank notes). Also, special ink is printed on both side of the sheet and the images are slightly raised. Then comes the most important stage -- inspection. In this step, workers are needed to manually inspect the quality of sheets and divide them into three groups: good quality, partially damaged quality and bad quality. Sheets in the second groups then get seperated into good ones, which, together with good quality sheets, enter a process of packaging and distribution where seperate notes are cut and finally enter the market, and bad ones, which go to disposal with bad quality sheets, where both groups get securely destroyed.\nThis leads us to a conclusion that the process of bank notes creation is secure as well as simple.",

Thank god for his existence in this world. “ It’s time for us to shine,” His handwritten words come to life in her mind. She could distinctively hear his low, manly voice in her head. His deep chuckles still made butterflies in her stomach. \n\nHer mind wandered to the first moment she laid eyes on beautiful Danny. She pursed her lips. It was not an absolutely pleasant experience. In fact, she was still cringing at that ugly thought. Inhale. \n\nThe room was full of sweaty bodies. They were moving in slow-motion. Every movement seem to take a minute to execute. Alison took a step forward and slammed into  someone’s soaked t-shirt.  \n\nDisgusting. Alison quickly wiped the remains of the person’s sweat with her hands. Her lips curled in disgust.\n\n“ Excuse me?” His voice boomed. The person was holding her wrist, preventing her from wiping any sweat on her face.\n\nShe finally looked up. Wide eyed, red lips, rosy cheeks, broad-build and a little stubble on his chin, he looked incredible. \n\nShe couldn’t help staring and realised his eyes were not the shade of any typical blue. This blue eyes, were much darker with insecurity, doubt and mystery. \n\nHer eyes gazed to his lips. He must have applied some lip stick for it to be that red! Alison swallowed her laughter inside her, knowing this was not the appropriate time to joke around.\n\n“ Excuse me?” His voice boomed louder this time. \n\nExhale.\n\nShe opened her eyes. She did not want to remember anything further on that night. It was terrible but it was the only night she met Danny. If that terrible night did not happen, what is happiness? What is hope? What is love? What is the point of living? She knows, she knows and she knows it is so wrong to put all happiness, dreams and hopes on someone that may leave anytime but she could not help it.\n\n",

We do not need to go down that road again. We can avoid repeating the same mistake again and again.\n\nFirst of all, let me tell the adavantages. They are obvious, nevertheless, I feel I should repeat them. Each book can be used by more than one person. Therefore, it is cheaper. We can save money and trees. The former does not need any explanation. The latter is going to be more important as time passes.\n\nNext we could ask for help to our community. I have some books in my library I could donate. I have them because I have paid for them, not for other particular reason. I imagine I am not the only one who could donate books. Last but not least, we could create an association that could be in charge of receiving books at the beginning. Later, it could support other school initiatives. \n\nIn conclusion, we should provide free books to our students. We must stop wasting our resources.",

So the problem for me is the way the movie is made, with several changes from the original script. Furthermore, the main actors’ performance is not very good because they are not completely inside in their roles.\nAlthough there are a lot of things which could be improved, not everything is bad in this movie! An example of that it’s the extremely amazing soundtrack with a really beautiful song of Pablo Alboran, a Spanish singer. Other good features are the customs and the landscapes which give to the movie a very realistic image and carry the spectators to that time\n",

Don't worry, I'll try to make it easy for you to decide which is the option that suits you best.\n\nOn the one hand, you've been doing sport since you were seven years old and I understand it's very important for you. It's an activity that you need to do every day, now that it's a good way to keep fit. However, as far as I'm concerned, it's not necessary to work out that much to be healthy. As a matter of fact, you just have to eat a balanced diet and do sport twice or three times a week. That way, you will be able to do sport as well as going to music classes.\n\nOn the other hand, you love playing piano and, in my opinion, you won't be able to keep it up if you give up music classes, as you don't have any instruments at home. Besides, I don't think your parents would buy you a piano, since it would really annoy your neighbours. Besides, as I have already said, you can exercise three or four hours a week instead of going every day to your training session. As I see it, you couldn't live without music even if you tried. Now it's your time to choose.\n\nI hope my advice makes sense to you and that it helps with your decision. \n\nBest of luck with your dilemma and don't forget to write and tell me the outcome!\n\nLove\n\nAriana\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "text": "Dear Editor,\n\nI am writing to inform you that the package holidays to Madrid you are currently advertising in your newspaper are apparently not what they claimed to be. I believe you should be fully informed about the quality of the services in the advertisements you publish, as your readers could be negatively biassed towards your paper only due to such incidents.\n\nGenerally, the holiday as a whole was good enough as the most important –in my opinion- aspects, like the quality of the guided tours and the accommodation, was very high. Nevertheless, there were many inaccuracies in the advertisement and certain aspects of the holiday were chaotic. \n\nThe fist day was a great shock to me as I realized I would be part of a group. The tourist agency made group bookings, which resulted in the unusually low price of the holiday package. Spending holidays with a group can be very convenient and for some people is the only way of travelling, but the advertisement did not state clearly that it concerned this particular type of holiday, which made me and some others feel deceived. Another point of concern was transportation. We had several problems, especially with the bus, which was often delayed and in one case it even caused us to miss a scheduled guided tour.\n\nI believe there is plenty of room for improvement since, although the problems were not insuperable, they caused great inconvenience. Firstly, a better transport agency should be found for the former difficulties to be prevented. Secondly, advertisements should be clearer as it is very easy for someone to misunderstand them. But the most important issue is the improvement of the general organization. Much time lost could have been saved with a few phone calls, for example waiting for half an hour in a  queue could have been prevented if a call had been made to the museum before we arrived there.\n\nI assume that the tourist agency can think of better solutions than me, but I hope that my recommendations will be taken seriously.\n\nBest Regards,",

Some people think that this job should be done by the parents and others think unfairly that this is the teacher's responsibility.\nOn one hand, parents should take responsibility on their children education as they are a child's first contact. Also, parents are like models to follow for their children, and as children do what they see they will copy their parents actions.\nIndeed school is the first place where a children interacts with society. However, they will talk or build a relationship based on what they see their parents doing with other people. Ultimately, teachers may have different values from the ones of the parents.\nOn the other hand, parents may have lack of time to spend with their children due to demanding jobs and to provide everything that their children need, for example pay for their children school. It can also be argued that children spend most of their time at school and not at home, making the school responsibility to pass good social values. But it should not be forgotten, that parents have the most influence as they are models to follow.\nTo sum up, parents should take full responsibility for their children education.

  "text": "REPORT ON THE COURSE \"Good design using DTP\"\n\nThe aim of this report is to briefly describe the main strengths and weaknesses of the course \"Good design using DTP\" so as to give an overall view of it. \n\nDESCRIPTION  \n\nThe course took place in the Training center in Regent Street - London on the 14-15 of May, as scheduled. All the participants, which were ten in total, were given a personal computer for the duration of the entire course in order to put into practice what was taught. Furthermore, the organizers had carefully planned the whole course, including meals and beverages too.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n\nThe tutor, Will Reeves - a lecturer of the University of Cambridge, succeeded in covering the whole program in an extremely effective way. To begin with, he focused on design considerations with DPT, explaining what software to use, and then he went on to tell us about typography and fonts, layout and balance as well as graphics and logs. Therefore, he concluded the course by making color considerations and showing proofing and printing. The highpoint, however, was the final practical exercises which gave us the opportunity to test our comprehension. \n\nFAILURES\n\nDespite the strengths mentioned above, there were also some areas that required some attention. Not only was the venue inconvenient but it was also dirty. The general dissatisfaction was perceived by the lecturer too, who pointed it out to the organizers who immediately started looking for an alternative venue. In addition, in spite of having paid a lot, the participants were not allowed to take any materials away, and this resulted in obtaining a less effective result as the participants didn’t have any materials to use to revise. \n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTo sum up, the course was generally successful, as the positive feedback received suggests. In conclusion, we would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in this subject for both the quality of the course and the unquestionable preparation of the tutor. ",

They have to immigrate to another place since their homes are destroyed, and during the immigration most of them would die because of lack of water, high temperature or predators.Besides, those animals who successfully arrive at proper place to live are likely to suffer from disease, because they didn't exposed to such a new environment before.\n\nAlthough there are many people and animals are suffer from these problems, i do believe that the government can take some actions to solve them.Firstly, laws should be set to forbid some projects which cause massive problems to the environment. Secondly, it is necessary for the government to warn people the serious problems caused by constructing large-scale buildings.\n\nTo summarise, large-scale building projects create massive problems which are harmful to human and animals,but the government can be helpful in solving these problems \n\n",

I would like to answer some questions from the guideline on Moodle, to explain how this course helped me to improve my English. So, the first two questions are: Has my writing improved and how did this happen? And the other questions: Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process? \n\nSecondly, has my writing improved and in what way did this happen then? From my point of view, my writing definitely has improved from the beginning of this school year till now. I discovered that I know many more words than I thought and I can make well-structured sentences now, which I couldn’t do so well at the beginning of this school year. This has to do with the technical grammatical features I learned in class as well. The way I see it is that I learned to use cohesion in a correct way, which makes the paragraphs that I write more clear. Besides that, I use cohesion which I didn’t use before this course. A few examples are: from my point of view and it seems to me. \n\nSubsequently, I would like to answer the next two questions. Which areas of my writing would I like to improve and did the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process? Although I believe that I already have improved my English since the beginning of the school year, I’d like to improve my English vocabulary. As I see it, the bigger the vocabulary, the better the writing process. More words can be add in the article, so there can be a better explanation of the subject. It’s my belief that the free writing presentations helped me with my writing process. I learned a lot of new words during the presentations, which I used in my free writing. \n\nTo finish, I can conclude that this English course has been very useful to me, because it has improved my English very well. The way I see it is that the grammatical features learned in English course, always can be used later on in life. For example, when there have to be sent letters in English. ",

People from other parts of the world are also heading for the same dream. Having own car or means of transportation is the dream of every individual including me.

But most of us just from far; we really do not imagine how this can affect people who suffer it.\n\nUnfortunately, many people are damaged, not only physical but mentally and the worst is that violence destroys families and also involves their sons in the hell it causes. Children quite often feel guilty of cannot avoid these troubles or help their mothers to escape from them and tend to think they are doing something wrong when they obviously do not. They are just the most sensitive and innocent victims of mistreatment.\n\nIt is very serious and hard to solve because victims have to be very strong and brave to recognize and face these situations and being able to report their aggressor so as to manage the matter finishes. This is so difficult due to the fact that they usually feel stupid, miserable, hopeless and do not feel good about themselves. Their aggressors make them become insecure and they think that they are alone. Even, in most cases, they feel ashamed or afraid of these situations and prefer saying nothing to tell their truth. \n\nAll those people who are living this abuse have to know that they are really important and deserve to be happy and free and they are not alone. There are many people who worry about and are willing to help and support them. There is always someone who you can count on in your family, friends or associations, but you must ask for help.\n",

  "text": "We need to consider both sides of the argument for public transport use prior to reaching a conclusion. Public transport is used for many reasons and can be convenient for different circumstances. There are many reasons for using public transport, such as commuting in to the central business district. This form of transport can be used to avoid delays due to traffic conditions and parking restrictions. It can provide an opportunity for people to complete work during the journey. Public transport may be the only option for individuals who do not drive or have access to a car. It is more environmentally friendly because it has the potential to reduce the numbers of vehicles on the road. However, the public transport use can be affected by a number of factors such as mechanical failures and environmental issues. It may be expensive to use for some individuals and crowded during rush hours. Using the car can be more flexible for some individuals. A car can be useful for effective performance of many tasks. It is easier to change routes when circumstances change unexpectedly. However, a car can be expensive to maintain, park and fuel.\n\nI think there is a role for both methods of transport after taking in to account all of the above reasons. The reasons for use is dependent on the individual and the circumstances.     ",

It's worth seeing because a young boy, Charlie, helps him get through his sadness in a very luxurious trip to New York.\n\nOne problem is that some scenes are too long, like the one in which they're having dinner with the colonel's family. However, the drama is perfectly achieved in each scene and they keep you tied to the screen.\n\nSo, overall I strongly recommend  it if you like redemption stories, and if you want to learn some pieces of advice for your life.

  "text": "The reading discusses the idea of how advance communication technologies give us an advantages of creating a 24/7 international working day and provides several reasons of support. The professor, however, disagrees with points made in the article and explains that this system has its own disadvantages.\n\nFirst point the professor addresses involves the reading's assertion that creating two or three teams situated in different geographical locations will help reduce the work hours for each team and at the same time it will decrease the time frame of getting the project done. The professor refutes this point of view by saying that based on his own experience this team work could be not so much beneficial. For instance, some group could have questions, but it would not be able to ask the other group because they would sleep at that time. Therefore, the working group will do its assumptions and may cause a waste of time. Moreover, the group in California may do work in one way and a group in India do same work differently, so it will be challenging to bring both of them to the same way of getting things done.\n\nAnother point from the article that the professor opposes is the claim that telecommunication helps to solve many problems that physical separation would cause to businesses.

  "text": "\nIt is not easy to prove that there is a relationship between organizational culture and performance. For a very long time there has not been scientific evidence that proved the relationship between organizational culture and performance, until studies found a correlation between these subjects. These four studies are put together in a model named ‘Organization Culture Performance Model’ (OCPM). This model tells us that the culture is determined by actual behavior of individual or groups of employees.  The culture is caused by organizational variables. These variables include internal and external cultural expects. The external aspect is: external client orientation. The internal aspects are: design of organization, communication, HRM-orientation and leadership. This variables influence the behavior of employees. The model distinguishes three kinds of expected performances:  individual-, groups-, and organizational performances. There isn’t a direct relationship between organizational culture and actual performances, but there is a direct relationship between organizational culture and expected performances. The researchers found that there is a big difference between what the boardroom preach and what the employee’s experience.\nA short summary of the OCPM- model: there are organizational variables that determine the visible and invisible behavior of employees. These variables and behavior of employees determine the expected performance and then there is the actual outcome.",

  "text": "Should smoking be banned?\nMore and more people nowadays try to  find some ways of relaxation, due to a fast pace of life and stress. Smoking appeals to hearts of many people of different generations, because it gives a fast relief for a short period of time, that is also quite reasonable.\nIt`s a fact that tobacco is used as a light drug for centuries by people of different nationalities. It`s a real issue for the government to understand that if the process of banning smokers starts, the income rate will immediately decrease. Moreover tobacco contains a vitamin, called PP1 that is beneficial for your health. It also helps to overcome some stressful situations, even though it`s temporarily, it`s still beneficial for your heart, rather than being constantly stressed.\nFinally smoking is personal choice of freedom for everyone.\nOn the other hand, smokers sometimes even don`t realize that their children or relatives become passive smokers too. It`s important to understand that you are responsible for your surroundings and people around you. So if your habits can be harmful for them you need to understand what`s a cost of it. For the same reason  government needs to control the situation,by using banning strategy if people smoke in one of forbidden ares, like kindergartens, schools , hospitals, etc. \nIn my opinion, people need to have freedom to make decisions on their own, but as soon as it starts to be a treat for others, they should be stopped immediately.",

  "text": "Discuss the risks and impacts of climate(weather)-related natural disasters.\n\nOver the past few decades, human activities have changed global climate, hence we are facing higher risks of weather-related disasters.  Furthermore, various destructive disasters have struck into the whole society with many negative elements, drawing the attention of citizens toward catastrophes.  Natural disasters such as drought can be generally defined as one that has a far-reaching influence because its long duration and wide scope.  This essay will examine global warming and precipitation shortage as causes of drought, followed by two main negative impacts in terms of the economic and social problems in agriculture.\n\nOne of the overt reasons for weather-related natural disasters is global warming.  It is obvious that global warming can be attributed to greenhouse gas emissions.  Moreover, the world’s uncontrollable population results in the demand of cars, industries and farming industries, that have contributed to greenhouse gases.  With the cause of human activities, the temperature of sea surface and the atmosphere have been gradually growing to a new level.  van Aalst (2006) pointed out that an increase of earth mean surface temperature with approximately 0.6 degrees has been explored over the past century, with the phenomenon which has been observed that land temperature has exceeded that of seas by a quicker speed ( p.6 ).  In addition, most of greenhouse gas emissions can affect the atmosphere for decades, which might cause marine monsoon inaccessibility to mainland resulting in low rainfall.  Another phenomenon can be caused by global warming is the decrease of snow coverage in relation to glaciers melting (van Aalst, 2006, p. 7).  Thus, it can be seen that global warming has accounted for a series of extreme weather phenomenon.    \n\nUndoubtedly, all the factors are responsible for the soil water shortage and decreasing precipitation.  Generally, the increase of temperature has resulted in a surge of hot days, and a drop of cold days.  This will largely causes less of soil water and precipitation.  Additionally, this event is different depending on the areas.  The area as mid-continental will unquestionably become dryer and insufficient precipitation, which is possible to make it more vulnerable to summer droughts (van Aalst, 2006, p.8).  “It is estimated that 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be exposed to water stress due to desertification induced by climate change”, states by IPCC ( as cited in Baker, 2012, p. 20).  In brief, there will be serious consequences in terms of less precipitation due to extreme weather.\n\nIn the economic aspect, drought has brought a tremendous problem of yield for agriculture.  As a consequence of both direct and indirect impacts of agriculture, prolonged drought can be commonly defined as the biggest factor.  The direct impact of prolonged drought is the reduction of incomes for farmers result from the decrease of output.  This can lead to the loss of profits from upstream and downstream throughout the supply chain, which can produce directly negative impacts for producers, as reported by Bauman, Goemans, Pritchett and McFadden ( 2013, p. 62).  Moreover, it creates a colossal economic damage when the drought occurs: lives are lost, people and animals are forced to move to a new place, resources become unsustainable or even extinct ( Bergholt, 2012, p. 148). \n\nAnother stricken area is social perspective, which has threatened the majority of the population.  Firstly, drought has caused farming in some of the area, such as Africa where is an underdeveloped of infrastructure and a lack of abilities to react after emergency.  Moreover, farming is one of the most crucial impacts of weather-related natural disasters, and it has caused an important number of casualties for both mankind as well as animals.  Secondly, farming also has contributed to migration.  When public suffers from natural disasters and they are no solutions, they are forced to leave their home in order to move to a new place, which could affect the next generation that might confront a multicultural society.  Consequently, drought has led to severe social impacts of natural disasters.\n\nIn conclusion, catastrophes such as drought have produced immense economic and social impacts.  Not only human beings but also all the organisms are confronting the threat from climate-related natural disasters.  The fact is natural disasters have changed people and animal’s living environment bringing  about a multitude of influences in both direct economic revenue of farmers and indirect effects on enterprise.  Additionally, climate change relates to natural disasters also causes farming which has triggered death and forced people as well as animals leave their home.  More seriously, climate is continuingly changing and still contributing to natural disasters.  Thus, we should consider this kind of threat to our future.\n",

It is too early isn’t? It’s to early to talk about love at this day and age. Everything seems to strange when you fifteen and you are talking about love. Why is that so? Well, that question has been ringing in my mind for so many months. This past few months have made my life unfathomable, making me unable to grasp the idea of when is the right age to fall in love. \n\nTo me, falling in love, is to accept and admire those little things that exist in that human being. After I have accepted that,I will begin to push all their flaws aside, because their flaws will only make me fall in love with them even more.  I know it is wrong to have strong feelings for someone who is definitely older, and I know nothing will come out of it. So why bother loving someone who will never return that love back? To me, love is not about having two parties loving and embracing each other. Their life will be happier when you ceased to exist. Yes, it hurts, but at the end of the day, almost everything in this world, will make you bleed. It will make you cringe, bawl like baby. It will make you feel vulnerable but that is life. \n\nThey will always love you base on your looks then personality. No matter how wrong I may sound, believe me, it is so true. \n\nLove is not all happy. Love can kill you. It can kill your soul. \n\n\n\n",

Some people do not think of walking as a sport, they believe that a sport has to be a rough activity one that left you overtired and sweeting. But in my opinion a sport is any activity that requires a certain amount of physical activity, one that can help you to improve your health.\n\nI enjoy walking because it allows you to do physical exercise and talk, watch the landscape or do other things at the same time. Walking is also a sport that almost everybody can do. If you are young you could walk fast, if you are old or not especially fit, you could start walking at a slow pace and with time improve your performance\n\nI would like to give some advice to the people who want to start walking: Take your time, do not want to walk ten kilometers the first day, try first short walks and every day increase the distance. You will find yourself walking  a little longer and faster than the day before.\n\nAnd if you do that then, sooner than later, you will become a walking enthusiast",

  "text": "\nIt is sometimes maintained that when manufacturers and retail companies try to persuade us to buy something, colour is a very effective thing which helps them do that. I think it is true that colour do influence our decision when we buy different things. \n\nFirstly, I am convinced that colour is very important when people buy clothes, especially for women. No doubt that manufacturers know which colour is popular and fashionable in a particular season and correspondingly it means that things of this colour will be sold well. In addition, companies are used to conducting different surveys to find out which colour is more popular in various social classes. For instance, I have recently read that people who belong to middle class prefer pink and green colours due to some psychological reasons. \n\nFurthermore, colours which are used in decoration of shops or restaurants are also rather influential. For example, psychologists are convinced that red is a colour which stimulates people's appetite and makes them feel hungry. That is why the predominant colour in McDonald's is red likewise in some other cafes and restaurants. \n\nHaving said this, however, I think that there are many other factors which are even more important than colour for people when they buy something. For example, if I liked a thing, I would not think much about its colour or a colour of the shop where I found it. Moreover, for many people the main factor is a price of a thing but not its colour. \n\nTo some up briefly, I would like to say that there is a special branch of psychology which investigates consumers' tastes and factors which influence their choice. Thus, we can conclude that colour is a powerful tool but in the same way manufacturers and retail companies should take into consideration other factors.",

This is the innovation that such a worldwide media is bringing to our society. Anyway, I wonder whether it would be useful and able to increase our culture and help us to be more critic towards life rather than impose its power on us. A recent research shows us why there is always an increasing number of children who are getting used to spend most of their afternoons in front of the television, not to miss a new cartoon nor a well-known film: they seem like they are unaware of the existence of documentaries, news and all the other educative programmes which today televisions are plenty of. It has been suggested by some European governments to introduce televisions in schools to give the opportunity to discuss together about present topics and problems, in order to learn something more about the world we are living in. I am sure that, if taken up, this idea will surely be a failure. In view of the above arguments, I would suggest anyone to cut out on television in order to have more time to read newspapers daily.

  "text": "In my opinion there is future for public transport.\nFirstly public transport is useful for people that cannot afford a car and their work is far away from where they live.Public transport is also useful for some children that need to go to school but they don´t live close to one.The only choice for many people is to use public transport.\nSecondly public transport is better for the environment than using cars because a bus has more space than a car and many people can go on a bus thus decreasing the amount of pollution and helping the enviromnent.\nLastly if the use of public transport decreases drastically or stops many people will be unemployed,they could not win more money and buy cars for going from one place to another.The countries will have Crisis and this will probably lead to another World War.That will be a complete disaster because now we have nuclear weapons and we would destroy the world.\nIn conclusion public transport is very important for every person in some way and without it everything will be a disaster  ",

  "text": "Taking a year off after finishing school can be harmful depending on what you're planning to do in that year. Interrupting the momentum by taking a year off is  maybe the worst thing you can do. Unless you get a job in that year, to keep you busy, or do whatever that keeps you focused and gives you a routine, you shouldn't take a year off at all. Without the routine that studying gives you, with all the dealines, the exams, and other stuff that forces you to get things done, and, by consequence, teaches you to be a responsible person, which you would need to be when you get a job, you will simple be wasting one year of your life  by taking a break. One thing that I've learned in my life is that you never should take a break from your everyday routine unless you really need, due to fatigue or some other physical or pscychological reason, otherwise you will be, I repeat, just wasting time, time that you could be spending in an usefull way, by getting something done, or improving yourself academically, intelectualy or doing whatever you think that can enrich your life. So, whether you take a year off or not, my point is that you shouldn't be wasting your time. Don't waste your time, spend it in a fruitful way.\n\nI've wasted so much time in my life that even I found it embarrassing. I've wasted the best years of my life doing nothing. Now I'm doing something, although I will probably never see the fruits of my labor. \nI like to beleieve that, like the old Latin proverb  says (and I have already said this), there will be glory at the end to the man who endures hardships in his path. Maybe one day I will experience the glory that awaits at  high places those who walk through the narrow paths of life. Or, most probably, I won't.\nRegardless of what's waiting for me at the end, I will never give up walking through those hard paths no matter how challenging and hard they may be.\nThis is some intimate stuff I'm sharing with you my teacher. I hope you don't think that sharing these thoughts with you makes you my new best buddie. Your only job here is to teach me the subject you're supposed to teach. I don't need your friendship you bastard! I hope I don't get an F by saying this, but it is the truth, and I love being honest. I know,  as soon you put your creepy, wicked eyes on my composition I must expect a bad grade. Maybe I will bribe you at the end of school term to get a good grade. What do you think of that, you prick? I bet you love money, especially money obtained by illegal means, don't you?\nPoor teacher, I can only wonder how a teacher would react to see such a thing written by a student. ",

  "text": "I was alive! I was alive!...I couldn't believe it! Having gone through all those tough times; trials and tribulations and I was alive! I was as happy as a lark but soon it was getting dark. My leg was injured and it was as painful as a thorn in the paw; after countless hours of crawling. I couldn't bear the pain but I had to endure it to survive my ordeal. Leaning forward slowly, I started crawling slowly like a turtle along the slender hill; I was on all four! I was feeling as tired as a worn out shoe. After a long and tiring crawl, I needed to find a shelter from where I could seek refuge from the chilling wind howling over my head unabated. I kept my body very close to the icy ground in order to reduce the impact of the bone-chiseling wind. Suddenly I saw a small gap between two blocks of snowy hills just enough for me to lie down in. The place was a bit gloomy and cold but I had no choice; I was too tired to move on. But before I knew it I was asleep. I woke up to the sound of the howling wind once again, in a state of vertigo. Looking down at the watch on my wrist, I realized it had been nearly a week since I survived the fall over the snowy cliff and now I had to go through this all alone with no improvement to my dire predicament. I continued crawling on all four while wondering, for how much longer, Simon till we meet again. I never stopped praying all along; in hope that somehow, somewhere, someone would come along to rescue me. As I was climbing downhill, I found myself getting blisters on my palm in a manner I could have no control over. The pain was excruciating but I just had to move on as if I ever hoped to survive my ordeal! As quickly as I could, I managed to get myself to the nearest leafless tree that I could find where I leaned my back against it to try to gain whatever support I could muster with the little energy that I had left in my body. I was a broken man; barely alive! Emphatically I reminded myself that I shouldn't have survived had it not been for God's help! I kept praying to God to give me the inner strength to carry on although I was fully aware of my own self-imposed exile from church services the last two years. Doubts began to creep in, \"Would God show his mercy?\". With the pain, doubts, hunger all crashing down on me, I was about to give up my fight for ultimate survival. A second thought crossed my mind telling me that I would miss my family and my best friends! I had to carry on to fight to stay alive! The very thought of winning an accolade in front of a jubilant crowd disappeared all together and all I ever wanted was to be home, be safe, and be with my family. ",

  "text": "There is no doubt that the subject of keeping animals in zoos creates a lot of debate. Some people say zoos are traditional family entertainment and good for animals. Others say keeping animals in zoos is cruel and inhumane.\nOne advantage of zoos is that they give people the chance to see and learn about animals. This makes people more likely to want to look after animals and protect their natural habitats. Due to the interest in protecting animals, people are eager to take part in organizations such as World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) which is an international non-governmental organization working on issues regarding the conservation, research and restoration of the environment.\nAnother positive aspect of zoos is that they help to protect endangered species by offering them a safe place to live. In addition, zoos help to find mates for endangered species. For example, many pandas would not find a mate to breed with if they were on their own in the wild.\nOn the other hand, there are many arguments against keeping animals in zoos. Firstly, zoo animals often suffer from stress and boredom when they are not in their natural habitat. Secondly, unwanted animals are sometimes sold to circuses, hunting parks or for meat. Consequently, they are mistreated, hit and live in an inadequate place where they cannot behave freely.\nAnother drawback is that animals sometimes escape from their enclosures, which is dangerous for humans. This is clearly seen when driving in the route and suddenly you see a bull or a cow in the middle of the way. this may cause not only the animal death by being run over but also the passengers' death if the driver tries to stop and lose the control of the car.\nTo conclude, there are strong arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos. Personally, I think it is acceptable to keep animals in zoos, as long as they have enough space and are properly looked after.\n\n\n",

  "text": "The influence of the grown-ups: great or not so?\n\nRecently I have listened to a discussion on how adults can be a good influence on young people. This got me thinking, how do adults influence the behaviour of youngsters? And is this always a good influence, or should adults interfere less with the behaviour of younger people?\n\nAdults can influence the behaviour of youngsters in different ways. First of all, they can give rules to younger people. This can differ from the rules your parents have set for you, to the laws created by the governmen. These rules can influence behaviour in a positive way, because they prevent you from doing stupid things. Secondly, adults can offer advice to the youngsters. This might be of great influence on youngster, for adults are seen as the wiser people. They have more life experience so they probably know what they are talking about. Lastly, adults can set an example for younger people. Think of celebrities for example. They are of great influence on younger people. When someone greatly admires a person, they will try to behave like them. So when admirable adults set good examples for youngsters, they can influence behaviour in a positive way.\n\nHowever, it isn’t all that great. Because young people often don’t like to be belittled. So setting rules might cause them to do the exact opposite. Especially when they have to live under a great lot of rules. Also, advice isn’t always taken positively. This is because adults lived in a complete other time, so their advice might be outdated. This causes young people to ignore the advice. Lastly, when a wrong example is set, this can influence behaviour in a negative way, because they’ll try to act to this wrong example. \n\nSo all in all, there are many ways in which adults can influence the behaviour of younger people. And whether this is taken positively, is completely up to the adults and youngsters themselves. \n\n",

  "text": "Myths and facts about frozen shoulder\n\nFrozen shoulder or shoulder stiffness is an extremely limiting and debilitating disease. The condition starts with pain when you move your shoulder joint and then progresses into total failure and limitation of the shoulder. Although very important and critical, there are lots of myths surrounding it and many patients suffering the disease do not know the real facts about it. Today we will make a spotlight on the famous facts and myths about “Frozen shoulder”.\n1-\tMost of the patients believe they have got frozen shoulder due to a trauma or injury in the shoulder joint, but this is a myth because frozen shoulder can occur after a trauma or even without any trauma as in elderly people especially those who have diabetes and those recovering from an operation. \n     \n2-\tIf you believe that doing exercises worsens your condition, then that is another myth because frozen shoulder occurs to people who stop or decrease using their shoulder joint for a long time. Usually after major operations, having a stroke or bone fracture. They ignore using full range of joint motion to avoid the pain sensation. So an inflammatory response starts leading to the joint stiffness, movement becomes painful and range of movement is limited by time.\n\n3-\tAn important fact about frozen shoulder is that no surgeries are usually needed. The first treatment that your doctor will suggest is medications such as analgesics and paracetamol. In addition to this, physical therapy is also an important way of treatment to maintain a full range of movement. Cortisone injections are also helpful, these injections can improve everything; decrease swelling, stiffness and pain. Surgery is our last resort if the condition is severe and all the previous lines of treatment failed.\n\n\n4-\tIf you believe that you can easily prevent frozen shoulder, then of course you are right. You can never have a frozen shoulder if you followed these advices:\n\n-\tIf you had a surgery or an injury, you should keep moving your shoulder joint within a limit even if it is painful.\n\n-\tHaving physical therapy after a surgery or trauma is crucial. Physical therapy returns your body to its previous healthy condition before trauma. If not done, healing is not fully completed and the joint remains painful. Therefore, further avoidance of movement occurs and leads to frozen shoulder.\n\n-\tPhysiotherapy is not only about exercises, some physiotherapy techniques can decrease your pain and suffering.\n",

  "text": "Introduction\n\nThe aim of this report is to inform an international organisation how our town takes care of the environment as well as what do people do with their rubbish and how the town is trying to keep the area clean and attractive.\n\nWhat people do with their rubbish\n\nNowadays young children are well informed about the dynamics and the complexity about the pollution cycle. However, it is estimated that at least 70% of young kids do not take care of their personal rubbish and are the main contributors to a polluted environment. \nBesides the fact that adults were not as well taught as children in school, they are the most civilized and responsible. A study shows that adults take care of their personal garbage not just because of their education but because of their anxiety to show their kids that they are a great and responsible parents.\n\nHow the town tries to keep the area clean\n\nAccording to our mayor, there are several points that our town really cares about to always keep our area as clean as possible. Every year we nominate a person that is responsible for supervising the dustman's work every single day. \nAs far as I am concerned there are now a few rules in our town legislation that if you do not take care of your garbage or if you take papers to the floor you will have to pay a fine. This fine can reach between 100 and 150 euros.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude this report, there are many things that still need to be done.

  "text": "Environmental problems are becoming more and more serious all over the world. There are some kinds of pollution such as garbage and wasted bottles, but some pollution is invisible such as noise and dirty air. Air pollution is the most serious problem among all other kinds of pollution nowadays. They have already had great impact on people’s life. \"Air\" is one of the necessities to maintain a human being's life. However air pollution affects not only people health but also the whole environmental system. \n\nChina is a big industrial country so there are a great number of factories and trucks. Much dirty air is released every day. Trucks have made the air unhealthy for people to breathe and poisonous gas is given off by a lot of factories. It also makes oxygen lacking but more and more carbon dioxide, the same result as CO2. CO2 can destroy the ozone. If we don't start to face this problem, we will hurt this planet we live in.\n\n\nEnvironmental problems that touch us all. Not only the government should make laws to control the situation but also we should do our best not to create more pollution. For Example, if you don't smoke, you won't cause air pollution and you won't damage your health; if you use public transportation, walk more or take bicycle as your transportation, you will not only help reduce the pollution bust also improve your health. Also, planting more trees instead of cutting them to purify our breathing air and reduce air pollution.\n\nWhile there are many things to appreciate and celebrate about the world in which we live many pressing environmental problems cry out for our attention. To maintain the only earth we live in is now the major issue for us nowadays. It's also our responsibility to protect it and to do our best to prevent it from being polluted.\n",

They have asked me to choose a thriller and it has been so easy it feels bad. \n\nI am going to start with the actors of this movie. Most of them were not stars when they made it. They became stars because of this film. Therefore, it would be incredible expensive to reunite all of them again for another film. They are credible, especially Kevin Spacey, Charles Palminteri and Gabriel Byrne.\n \nThe Usual Suspects is the first movie by Bryan Singer. I think it is the best one too. At that moment he seemed like the new Steven Spielberg. Nowadays he has turned into another director. The photography is also good. The soundtrack is not spectacular. It has a pair of good tunes and they use them. The script separates this film from the others.\n\nThe script is made of pure gold. It is so tightly knitted you do not realise it is telling you the story of a failure. There is a scene, at the very end, where you can see a transformation. You become aware of what was going on and you start to travel back into the film story. That moment is priceless.\n\nI think that the best way to recommend this movie to anyone one is to quote from The Usual Suspects: “the best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.”",

Therefore and to sum up,  Is my view, that public money is better spent supporting mix sex schools, which reflects the society we live in, as opposed to single sex´ which may reinforce those stereotypes that are mining society.",

Travelling by car is not only much more convenient than public transport, it also grants one's independence to go wherever and whenever one might wish. Moreover, driving grants motorists one of the most popular feelings in Western societies: the feeling of being free.\nEven if it is true that many citizens use public transport when their finances are tight, it is also true that most of those same people would use their private cars instead if given the chance.\nThe car industry could also be considered one of the main driving engines of the Western economy. It is difficult to imagine what the future would hold for the European economies if the car industry collapsed. Thousands would lose their jobs, both directly in the car factories and indirectly in many other car-related businesses, like car part stores, petrol stations, garages, and so on. If private transport was fully replaced by public transport, the world's economic foundations would shake and a global financial crisis of unprecedented impact could occur. \nIt is true that cars pollute the atmosphere, but it is also true that the emissions from public transport also contribute to pollution - some would say that even more than private transport, as Diesel motors are particularly dirtier and more inefficient than smaller, petrol driven motors like those of private cars.\nAll things considered we might conclude that public transport will eventually disappear in the short term and in no time everyone will be driving their own clean-energy-driven flying cars to go everywhere.\n",

However, others claim that it is vital for societies and next generations.\n\nGenetic engineering is the process of manipulating the genes of an organism. According to supporters of it, there are many benefits of genetic engineering. As it is known, it is used to produce crops that are more resistant to insects and diseases. Besides, some genetically modified crops grow more quickly. Supporters also claim that, it is vital for some countries which are struggling with famine. The other benefit is about human life. With  genetic engineering, human health has become better in many ways. For instance, it may be used by scientists to cure some diseases. Genes could be changed before a baby is born thus, inherited illnesses would no longer exist. It could also be possible to clone human organs so that we could have a chance to replace our damaged body parts. \n\nIn spite of the benefits, there are also certain drawbacks of human genetic engineering. There are many ethical concerns about human genetic engineering. It is still unacceptable in most cultures because of their religious beliefs. They believe that it is unnatural. Another problem is the genetically modified food products.

In both novels the writers also dealt with the mistreatment of children in workhouses (\"David Copperfield\") and Boarding Schools (\"Jane Eyre\").\nAlthough they may share these themes,  their ways of writing are quite different.In the Brönte sisters' works, we can find some Gothic elements - especially in Emily's only novel \"Wuthering Heights\"- and a detachment from the figure of the Victorian dutiful woman.

  "text": "Due to the ever-increasing population coupled with the climate change, food shortage has become a significant facing by many countries. Some assert that genetically modified technology can be applied to address this problem. This essay will argue that genetically modified food can be the way out of the problem of food deficit and this will be done by focusing on its environmental benefits and increasing food yield.\n\nFirstly, GM food can have a positive impact on the problem of food safety. It is well known that the GM food is inserted with various resistance genes, such as pest disease resistance gene. This means that the food being more resistant to pests and agricultural diseases can minimise the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers that can poison the water supply and pollute the environment. This reduction in the application of chemical materials can create a safer agricultural environment, ensuring food safety.\n\nFurthermore, GM food can also improve the production of crops. Due to the various new traits resulting from the GM technology, such as drought tolerance and salinity tolerance, GM food can ensure the food production in the period of drought. This could be important for food production, especially in developing countries. However, some may argue that it is also questionable whether GM food has a detrimental impact on human health. Actually, thousands of tests on GM food, before bring it into markets, have been proven that it is harmless to both the environment and human health.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that GM food can increase food yields with the less use of chemicals. In views of this, it is reasonable to believe that GM food might be an ideal strategy to alleviate the problem of food shortage. However, because there are some disadvantages in GM technology which is being developed, it is also recommended that governments should give more importance to the management of GM food.",

He thought that many students had decided to follow his last lesson and he was pleased and moved by this kindness.\nThere was very little light in the classroom because it had been a rainy afternoon and a terrible thunderstorm had caused an electrical blackout.\nWhen a student came in, also he was surprised to see so many people inside, but, after a while, he realized what was really happening: dozens of wet raincoats had been left on the chairs by students of another course.\nThe student didn't have the courage to interrupt his teacher and give him such a strong pain and disillusion: he slunk away while the old professor was still speaking enthusiastically to nobody.",

  "text": "Students Use of Leisure Time\nOn 3th March 2014, a survey was conducted among 60 students. The purpose of the survey was to discover popular leisure time activities of male and female students. \nThe survey was carried out by means of a questionnaire given to the male and female students to complete. It consisted of three parts. The first part of the questionnaire dealt with leisure time activities on holidays. The second section was concerned with time-out activities. The third part touched on the ways of spending free time at home.  \nFrom the table of data, the most significant items are as follows. It has been found in the first section that a large percentage of the male respondents preferred to stay at home on holidays, while 90% of the female students would like to go to the seaside. The male students would gladly go to historical places, while 57% of the girls who filled in the questionnaire weren’t inclined to spend their free time in that way.  \nIn the second section both the girls and the boys interrogated claimed that they don’t spend their free time going to the theatre or the opera. 53% of the male students never do that; while 50% of the girls stated that they try to go theatres and operas several times a year to expand their horizons. The majority of the male and female respondents enjoy going to nightclubs in their spare time. For example, only 10% percent of the boys never do that and 24% go to nightspots at least one time a week. More than a half of the male students spend their spare time doing sport two and more times a week. Unlike the boys the female respondents usually don’t feel like going in for sport at leisure. In contrast to the male respondents the girls interrogated go to evening classes in their free time. While 53% of the boys never do that. Like the male respondents the girls interrogated go regularly to the cinema. For instance, 47% of the female respondents watch films on a big screen every week.  \nIn the third part of the questionnaire was found out that the male respondents are similar to the girl respondents in that they both enjoy listening to music at home more than 2 hours a day. In contrast to the girls interrogated who almost never play computer games the majority of the male students gamble for hours at leisure. The female respondents are more fond of reading books that the male ones. 40% of the girls read books several hours a day, while 13% of the male students don’t read in their free time at all. The males who filled in the questionnaire and the females alike spend many hours by surfing the Internet. For example, 53% of the female students are on-line more than 3 hours a day. \nIf any conclusions may be drawn from the data, they are as follows. The leisure activities of the male and female students have a lot in common. There is an evident tendency to the decline in the active ways of spending free time. The young people of both sexes prefer to be on-line or playing computer games at leisure. According to the findings, it is clear that nowadays going to nightclubs and cinemas are more popular than going to theatres and operas or visiting historical places. There are therefore a clear need for young people to prefer active and educating leisure time activities to passive ones.\n",

In my opinion many people depend on public transport to get to their place of work, university or school. In terms of money it is much cheaper to travel by bus than to use your own car. If you compare the price of petrol with the price of a bus ticket you can clearly see how much better it is to travel by bus. I enjoy travelling by bus or train, on your journey you can read or just look through the windows. You don't need to get angry or mad if you don't find a parking space, you can just get on/off the bus wherever you like. You can also enjoy the company of those travellers sharing the same transport. Sometimes you can even meet new people on the bus.\nHowever, I must agree that travelling by car can give you more freedomn, you can carry your shopping and pick up other people on the way. Furthermore, you can choose what time you would like to travel and where. But despite all this there will always be people without a car who needs to commute every day so there is a long future for public transport.\n",

In the former, people have ability almost equally, and value interpersonal relationship. In contrast, agentic culture stresses the differences between individuals, along with egotism and inequality (Zarbatany, Conley, & Pepper as cited in Okazaki, & Taylor, 2013).

  "text": "Nowadays, famous people like movie stars, politicians, models and other celebrities suffer from lack of privacy. Paparazzi and journalists are following them everywhere they go. They are also the reason for many problems,which appear in private lives of some celebrities. It is known, that it is the job of paparazzi to follow famous people and look for sensation in their daily behaviour and celebs are aware of the fact, that they are recognised everywhere, but an interest in one's private life, when the person doesn't want to is basically a synonim for trespassing. I strongly agree with the statement, that famous people also should have their own private lives, which no one's following and that no one knows about it. It is very hard to lead a normal life, when you have to think all day long, about what you say, what you wear and first of all, what you do. Being a celebrity means working all the time,you have not a single moment to relax and forget about your work. On the other hand, it is obvious that people want to know everything they can about celebrities they like or admire and journalists give them the opportunity to find out some information about their lives, but they often cross the line and literally deprive these famous people of private life. In my opinion everyone deserves to have a private life even if he is a public person. I'm sure that no one would like to see his photo in a newspaper, on which he's eating or making a stupid face and that's why we should respect other's privacy.",

They think that due to scandals they will be able to get fame, live in the lap of luxury and have a lot of money.\n   On the other hand, not everybody prefers to reveal the secrets of the private life. For these kinds of people it is important not to bring out family scenes and problems, as they don't want to be disputed in public.

  "text": "The Soviet Union collapse has become one of the defining events in the world’s history. It influenced the further development of post-Soviet countries as well geopolitical situation in the whole world. It has also influenced the international relations not just within post-Soviet area, but also in the entire world, as the period after the collapse of the USSR was marked as crash of bipolar structure of international relations. So long as for fifty years the world lived under the shadow of the Cold War, fearing a fatal confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union, the dissolution of the USSR had a huge resonance not only in the US mass-media but also in the American society.\nAmerican press had widely illustrated the revolution in the Baltic States and the tension which has been spread in the Soviet Union after the fall of the Berlin Wall as well as the fall of communist governments within the whole former Soviet Bloc.\nThe tensions in the Soviet Union came to its peak in August 1991, while Gorbachev was on vacation in the Crimea, a group of right wing military and KGB leaders staged a coup in Moscow. The”New York Times” made a series of publications dedicated to the coup. They were published under the common title “Soviet crisis”. The articles headlined “Soviet crisis” have broadly described the situation in the capital of Russia. On the August 20, “New York Times” published the article which contained the excerpts from the news conference held by Acting President Gennadiy Yanayev and four other members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency .\nThe American press summing up the era of Gorbachov frequently highlighted his attempts to increase the openness of the Soviet society. Those attempts were considered as one of Gorbachov’s main merits. “The buried secrets of past regimes and the foibles of the present one were exposed to public scrutiny by a press ” – the New York Times wrote. \nThe plotters have immediately encountered strong opposition from the leadership of the RSFSR leaders under the guidance of President Boris Yeltsin. Tens of thousands hit the streets in Russia in order to defend the democracy. Decisive actions of Yeltsin have been supported by most world governments and international communities. Boris Yeltsin has gained international acclaim when he occupied the Russian White House and faced down the threats of the coup’s leaders. The coup, due to lack of organization and support by the military forces, failed three days after. The person of Boris Yeltsin has become the most popular one in that time world’s press. Leading articles of the most read newspapers in the States were dedicated to the first Russian president. American newspapers wrote that Boris Yeltsin acquired new status for his defiant stand, also mentioning that the people had knew a little about him . The article of the New York Post “THE SOVIET CRISIS; Yeltsin's Remarks: A 'Reactionary Coup”  refers to the night of 18-19 August 1991 when the legally elected President of the country was removed from power. The author lays the stress on the democratic processes in the country which have acquired broad and irreversible character. Also it shows the disposition of the soviet people towards the changes in the country. “The people of Russia are becoming masters of their destiny. The uncontrolled powers of unconstitutional organs have been considerably limited, and this includes party organs.” \nThis coup had a big resonance among the American society; consequently the US mass-media were eager to know the feelings of the US citizens about the situation in the Soviet Union. The US citizen deemed the crisis as a menace for the liberalisation of society; they assumed it as an actual barrier for the expression of people’s will. “In the hearts of many Americans, the cold war finally ended this week ”, the New York Times wrote. The press accentuated that many of Americans dusted off fears left over from the Cold War were harshly reminding that this is still the nuclear age. \nThe dissolution of the Communist party has also become one of most popular issues among American mass-media. The reduction of Gorbachov’s role and the growth of the Yeltsin’s haven’t been out of the attention in the US media sources. Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed a radical restructuring of the Soviet Union that would minimize the role of Mikhail Gorbachev and reduce the USSR to a loose confederation of nine republics. “The Communist Party, which has had control for 74 years, is rapidly dissolving  - the Chicago Tribune wrote.\nThe US mass-media followed the reaction on the crisis inside Communist party closely One of the articles of the Washington post “Soviet Turmoil Shakes Europe's Communists ”tells that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's call for dissolution of the Communist Party Central Committee has called into question the survival of its satellite parties in Western Europe. \nThe dissolution of the Communist party was concerned as the one of the features of the Soviet Union collapse. In the Washington Post the editorial remarks that the failure of the Moscow coup has finally broke the influence of the Communist Party over the power structures and the world outlook of Soviet people. As a result, the Soviet Union has been disintegrated along traditional ethnic lines .\nThe upshot of the matter is that the dissolution of the Soviet Union has caused the formation of the new states and following referendums on their independence. The leaders of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus formally announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union on Dec 8, 1991 and agreed to establish a \"Commonwealth of Independent States\" instead.\nThe official collapse of the Soviet Union has occurred in December 1991. On the 25th of December 1991 Gorbachov has officially resigned. The Washington Post has written down: “a spokesman for Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union will cease to exist by the end of 1991. Soviet President Gorbachev agreed to the dissolution of all Soviet agencies ”.

  "text": "This house believes that everyone should be able to speak English.\n\nA world where everybody is able to communicate in the same language - is that pure utopia or may it be a considerable idea? What would the possible advantages and disadvantages of a world wide spoken language be? Establishing English as the new worldwide spoken language might be a favourable example since English is already spoken by more than 300 million native speakers and therefore the third most spoken language in the world, according to Ethnologue. Moreover English is already a universal language used by many people to communicate or  negotiating within the business market. Imagining everyone had the opportunity to learn and therefore communicate with each other in a worldwide spoken language is certainly an appealing idea and would, without doubt, have many benefits.\n\nFirstly, as mentioned before, it would give everyone the opportunity to communicate with everyone. However, the realisation of English as a world language would certainly need an educational basis for everyone which might not be easy to accomplish but it would be possible. While teaching everyone English it would also be profitable to instruct basic knowledge in mathematics, physics or other relevant topics which might be helpful. \n\tSuch a standardised educational system for every single person on the world would therefore not only benefit the communication or existing businesses but also help third-world countries to start companies, trade and industrialise their countries so they can take care of themselves and emerge out of poverty.\n\nMoreover, the standardised educational system would also need people who teach and instruct others so the world language will be established everywhere. In order to accomplish this endowment there would be a necessity of teachers which leads to many new job opportunities. After all, a couple of professions might become extinct, for example translators, but, therefore, the organisation and execution of this big project would  provide a range of other jobs which can make up for the ones lost. \n\tThe educational system would also provide a valuable basis for the world of politics so conflicts might be prevented due to the lost language barrier with its vulnerability and risks of misunderstandings. In addition, civil wars or catastrophes like the Arab spring might also be avoided since there will be an educational standard which could teach different ways of political leadership. \n\nHowever, this great improvement still holds a few weaknesses. On the one hand there would be a great loss of cultures and in some cases the implementation of the educational system might be impossible, for instance the aboriginal people. Anyway,, those tribes would not even need or want an education or a world language because it is their way of life to live in groups together with the nature and disturbing these cultural groups would simply be unnecessary.\n\tOn the other hand the suggestion of English as the world wide spoken language might be up against much criticism since the United States do not have many supporters everywhere. Nevertheless, English was just a suggestion and other languages like Spanish or Chinese could certainly be used as well.",

  "text": "Nowadays, more and more people are learning how to drive, as driving one's own car is, as everyone knows, much more convenient than taking public transport. The future that lies ahead for public transport seems to be a bleak one. But is it really the case? Is it really that the end of public transport is soon to come?\n\nI hold an opposite view; my answer is \"no\", for sure.\n\nWithout doubt, having our own car provides us with great convenience. However, we should not overlook the fact that not everyone can afford a car. Some people may argue that we can buy a second-hand car if we can't afford a brand new one. Yes, they are right in saying so and in fact, many people are second-hand car owners. But they seem to have forgotten the extra cost incurred by maintenance and repair, and, of course, buying petroleum. The cost of having a car is hence not as cheap as we think if we also take into account those avoidable extra cost. Under this circumstance, some people may rather take public transport to save money for their \"dream house\" rather than buying a car. Not to mention that there are tourists in Hong Kong, who have no choice but to use public transport. It is clearly seen that there is still much room for survival for public transport. \n\nSecondly, even people have cars, they may also take public transport. As we all know, Hong Kong is famous for scarcity of land, there are not many parking spaces available, so employees may not be granted an official parking space by their company are hence may resort to public transport if they want to avoid the fees of using the parking lot. Having scarce land is not the sole problem in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is also famous for its heavy traffic, which implies the problem of traffic congestion. By taking MTR, one can save all the hassles of wasting precious time being stuck in a traffic jam. Besides saving time, taking public transport can also help reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases have already posed grave threat to humans, e.g. global warming and ozone depletion, which raised people's environmental awareness. People are becoming more and more aware of the importance of environmental protection and want to contribute to saving our Earth. In this regard, they may take public transport instead of driving their own car even if they have one. Hence, contrary to many people perceive, there should be an increasing demand, i.e. a rosy future, for public transport. \n \nFrom the reasons mentioned above, it is obvious that the doomsday of public transport is definitely not something down the line. But how about the future further far away? Maybe. Like our ancestors would have never imagined that we can now fly in the sky by plane. Technological advancement is, after all, always something that drops us a bombshell, so rapid that we can never predict how far it can go. Maybe one day we need no cars, or public transport. Simply by thinking of a specific location, we can go there in a split second. Who knows?\n",

There's not much work you have to do on a normal day, but maybe this will be a special one, because of the match between Celta and Real Madrid that is going to be celebrated half a kilometre away.\n\nFirst, you need to know how to open the establishment. I asked for my right-hand employee David to come earlier due to your arrival. He'll be in front of the place at 8.30, just 15 minutes earlier than we open the doors. The problem is David's shift ends at 14:00, so he won't be with you in the evening, when we usually lock up at 20:00. Once you close it, it would be great if you could let the keys in David's house, which is in the same building.\n\nThere is about 14 workers in the shop, divided in 2 groups with different schedule each one. They have similar skills and productivity, but, honestly, I prefer working with the morning one. I don't think you'll have any problem with both groups. \n\nIf there is any problem with the cash registrer (very common, actually), you have a phone number under it of a good technician. The bill will be assumed by us.\n\nWrite back soon and let me know if you have any concern.\n\nAll the best\n\nAlberte \n",

However, it is one of the most motivating challenge in our lives.\nTo start with, it is an essential feature in our lives. They are in constant adaptation to new events or personal experiences.For example, a close relationship or a serious illness make us look at the world around us through different eyes, and also they let us grow into more interesting and nicer human beings.\nEven so, change can be perceived as a disturbing question due to the fact that it provokes a strong feeling of uncertainty. Often, dealing with new situations does not help us to feel comfortable. Furthermore, we sometimes feel scared to face new experience and then we can lose a perfect opportunity to improve ourselves.\nIn short, I consider that change is always the best way to develop our personality to become better people in any aspect of our lives because it represents a major challenge.

  "text": "Nowadays, there's more to school than sitting quietly at the desk and saving mathematical equations. Classes are being held much more interactive than in the previous years, and also subjects are supposed to prepare pupils for adult life. In the following essay I want to discuss the most useful skills which should be taught in school from an early age on. \n\n First of all, it is essential for young people to learn how to take care of themselves, such as knowing how to cook. Fast food has become part of everyday life. In order to prevent the younger generation of our society of consuming it, we should give them the possibility to attend cooking classes. Not only is it an advantage for their health if they're able to create healthy meals, but also does it strengthen relationships among classmates, as they might help and support each other while trying new dishes. Moreover, it is a welcome distraction from the theoretical school routine. \n\n However, there's still a more important area to have a good knowledge about – personal finance. Some families may be able to afford money and don't think about its value. Passing this attitude on to their children, they won't be able to save money for emergencies and deal with it reasonably, which is a necessity in order to survive. Teachers can take up the role of the parents and giving them a knowledge about finances and the right way to handle it. \n\n To conclude, there are a lot of things worth considering to teach in school. The two most useful, in my opinion, are cooking classes and personal finance. Both of them are skills which help managing your life later on, finances in particular. \n \n",

He uses to travel from place to place following the most burning news around the world.\nAs a free lance, he has to invest in his ideas, hoping that someone will like his stories and buy them. \nTo fly in different continents is nowadays easy but still expensive. Therefore, Jake tries to arrange his stays with one goal in mind: travelling in a comfortable way but saving as much as possible.\n\nA few months ago month he had been spending two weeks in Brussels. He was following an important European summint on environmental issues. \nBrussels, Europe's capital, made his stay very pleasant. Jake was able to enjoy its multicultural environment and its great cultural initiatives. He could easily move from place to place at very convenient prices. Access to sevreal public transport services (such as underground, buses, tram, etc.) let him reach his working meeting always on time. He also had the chance to know more about the diverse atmosphere characterizing each and every Brussels' suburb. During winter Brussels might be quite cold.However,metros and buses are equipped with such a powerful heating systems that you forget about the cold.\n\nA few weeks later, Jake had to travel to the South of Italy to follow the case of immigrants reaching the coasts of Europe via sea from Africa and the Middle-East. He was so excited about that trip. Italy is his parents' country of origin and it was the first time for him to visit Italy. He was able to reach the South by a connection flight from Rome. It was spring, the prefect time to go and visit South of Italy. Nevertheless, his stay was not as pleasant as he had thought. Jake's main challenge was to move around and reach the places he had planned to visit both for his research and for tourist purposes. He soon came to realise how disorganised public transport is in the South of Italy. Its inhabitants move around exclusively on their own cars. Towns are congested by traffic jam, especially during rush hours. He was surprised by the poor quality of the air when walking around. The air was polluted by smog due to the huge number of cars. Jake could only move around by using the few expensive taxis available.\n\nSuch experience made Jake realise the considerable impact that a good public transport system has on people's life and their surrouding. In particular, an efficient public transport impacts on:\nStress - it makes your life easier since you avoid driving in the middle of traffic jam\nCommunications - it eases movements from place to place\nEnvironment - it reduces cars on the roads, therefore air is less polluted\nYour own and your community's pockets!? - access to public transport is way cheaper than taking care of your own car; though initially it might look like a huge disbursment of money from the community, in the long term it shows to be the most efficient way to travel!\n",

  "text": "Seville is well known for its stunning monuments. Although, I have been struck by its major draws such as Plaza De Espana, Real Alcazar and El Torre del Oro, this is the relaxed and social way of living which has most impressed me. Therefore, it all comes down in this writing to expressing feelings about Seville and its surrounding.\n\nFirst and foremost, it is difficult to feel deep emotions when it comes to living in a place without real social contact. Therefore, I miss my close-knit family and friends. I’m having a very nice time in Seville though. In fact, the more I know about its organization and its people, the more I feel at ease in Seville. It is almost as if I were at home now. I must well admit this has not always been so. To be honest, I was not very attracted by the spirit of the city at the very beginning of my stay. In my opinion, Seville was rather disorganized and not very charming and its citizens rather rude. Consequently, what are the reasons of my change of heart?\n\nIn my view, getting to know a city is quite similar to getting to know people. The more I understand it the more I like it. Of course, it may happen at times that I dislike what I discover! Luckily, this has not been the case so when it comes to Seville. This is partly due to the fact I have picked up a few words which enable me to interact more easily with its citizens. For example, people start to talk with me when they notice I make efforts to speak in their language. There are even some smiles and laughs, which is very reassuring for someone who is alone abroad. \n\nWhat’s more, Seville is bright, colourful and lively which cheers me up and relaxes me. For instance, I spent some time last night eating tapas on a small street in a laid-back atmosphere. I was surrounded by joyful Spaniards who were speaking loudly. Needless to say, I greatly enjoyed this time as it made me feel as if I were part of their life and of the place. To make matters even better, there was some music played a few meters ahead, which contributed to liven up the spirit of everyone present there.\n \nIn addition to this, I really like sharing tapas dishes with people, drinking a good fresh “draft beer” and going for a “tapas crawl” with friends as in Switzerland each one gets its own dish when eating out and only go for a “pub crawl”.\n\nI am also keen on wandering off at my own pace and getting lost on the winding narrow cobbled streets as I feel like an adventurer looking for new treasures. Some of these are striking secluded places such churches or Moorish-styled houses. Thus, scouring Seville is like rewinding the time and being propelled in the past. \n  \nOn account of all this, it is easy to understand why my perception of Seville has significantly changed over time. As far as I’m concerned, the city is no longer a museum displaying sumptuous and ostentatious monuments. It turns out to be now a very welcoming and relaxing place where warm-hearted people live and where I greatly enjoy spending some time.\n",

Those are great advantages everyone can see.\n\nRight now we have a problem: the oil reserves are depleting. That is going to happen sooner rather than later. It could seem to point towards public transport, nevertheless it will push car travelling even further. The reason is that, once we are free from our oil shackles, we will say farewell to most of its problems. There will be no more greenhouse gasses, you can forget about escalating gas prices and, finally, you will not remember air pollution.\n\nLast but not least, we are entering a digital era. Computers and smartphones are becoming more prominent in our lives. Why would I travel to a meeting in a different city when I can meet through Skype? I cannot find the reason.

This TV serial is mainly based on working class people and represents various ethnic minority communities including African and Asian Muslims.

It shows that ethnic minority people can integrate with the majority Caucasian people without losing their cultural and traditional values.  \n\nIn addition, it provides an opportunity for people from different backgrounds to peep into the culture and traditions of British people.  Although this soap involves a lot of cheating and plotting between characters, it also shows the importance of family values.  I would definitely recommend this drama serial to other people.

Secondly, it is unthinkable to suggest it in outdoor bars and restaurants - such an idea is completely unworkable.\nTo support my argument against this proposal I would like to explain what happened when the authorities attempted to introduce a ban on smoking in my home town. It was unsuccessful, and the politicians had to reverse their decision. In the first place, few people did know about this law, and, of course, most business opposed the idea. A non-smoking policy was introduced by some restaurants; the consequences were terrible: a large number of their customers vanished. If this happened in café Noir, probably I could lose my job.\nIn my opinion, introducing specific non-smoking areas in this type of establishments could be an excellent idea.

  "text": "Dear Margaret,\nFirstly, thank you for answering and don’t worry about the delayed reply!\nSecondly, I’d like to tell you some things about myself as well. It’s not easy for me to talk about myself, but I’ll give my best.\nI’ve been living in Augsburg for nearly two years now and am studying B.A. Anglistik and economics. Before moving to Augsburg, I studied biology for two semesters in Erlangen, but soon noticed that it wasn’t the right subject of study for me. So I switched and I’m happy to say that it was the right decision! Biology is still a hobby of mine, but I’ve always been good with languages and so I’m doing now something I’m naturally good at. \nI can speak English and of course German – and because my grandparents are from Korea, a little Korean, too. I am the only grandchild that can’t speak Korean properly because I grew up in Bavaria and not in NRW, but they taught me to cook. It started when I was a little child, and it’s what I do. When I’m stressed or trying to postpone things like studying or cleaning the flat, I cook. Sharing my flat with two boys is amusing most of the time, but when it’s about cleaning… oh my! The good thing is: the rest of the time living with boys is as uncomplicated as it gets. And we’re a pretty good team because all of my cooking led to many evenings spent together in our kitchen. \nMy other big hobby is travelling. I’ve been to Jamaica, Morocco, the Maldives and Curacao. Also I visited the USA multiple times: I travelled the west coast from San Diego to San Francisco, I’ve been to Las Vegas, Chicago and Boston. In less than two weeks, I’m going to fly to New York City. I’m so excited! \nSo, now you have a rough summary of me. \nI’m looking forward to working with you and wish you all the best until then!\nSee you soon,\nSarah\n",

It demands physical effort, being and excellent way to keep fit. It involves many moral virtues, which makes football one of the best activities for teenagers.\n\nStarting with the social skills, it is obvious that a football match is a dispute, a game we involve in with the intention to win. This kind of action, when peformed collectively, requires coordenation of efforts and abitity to work together, two qualities that are frequently forgotten in our individualistic world. If you play footbal, you know how to act when in a team.\n\nMoreover, footbal is a physical game. Unlike chess or bridge, football makes you leap, run, kick. In times of escalators and cars, it is refreshing to find an activity that involves movement, velocity and strenght. And if you do decide to take it seriously, this sport will put you through workouts and sustained practices that are going to make you really fit.\n\nFinally, football involves relationships in moments of tension, and this is the natural context for virtues like justice, courage and honesty. In fact, it can be argued that the human virtues are a by-product of conflicts and fights; that they are that traces of character that we aknowledge as important for everybody engaged in a competition, be it for a trophy or for a country. It is a sport that develops no only the body, but also the mind and the heart.\n\nIf you want to try it, you should find a club near you. It is easy, because football is one of the most popular sports in the western world. In a club you will find professional advice and also as many peopole as it is necessary for a match. In fact, if football has a downside, it is this, the fact that you need twenty-two people to set a match. But, provided that, you will have one of the best ninety minutes of your entire life.",

  "text": "    A Real Vacation and A Dream Vacation\n  To me, a vacation is a specific trip or journey for recreation or tourism. And I usually spend my vacation with my family during school break. However, there are two kinds of vacation, a real vacation and a dream vacation.\n  One summer vacation, I went on a trip to Paris with my family. It was a 10-day trip. And we had booked all our hotels in advance. It seemed to be a dream vacation. But it turned out to be totally different when I arrived there. It was in the afternoon when we arrived. When I walked out the airport, I was attracted by the beautiful scenery. The streets, the cafés and the people formed a beautiful picture. At night, I expected to have a romantic French dinner at a posh restaurant. But no, instead of sitting in a restaurant, my mum took us to a supermarket to get some sandwiches for dinner. In the next following days, we mostly had bread and sandwiches for our meals. And we had only water when we were thirsty. During these 10 days, we walked a lot instead of catching a bus, because it saved money too. But it made my legs sore every night. This is kind of the real vacation for me. Even though I was in a romantic city, I couldn't enjoy my vacation in a romantic way due to the low budgets we had. \n  To me, a dream vacation is like going to a beautiful island like Palau, where I can enjoy the sunshine and the sea. And I would like to go there with my boyfriend. When I am there, I would start my day by calling room service for a wonderful breakfast in bed. After, I would head to the sandy beach and relax in the sun, feeling the breeze. As the day goes on, I would also go swimming in the deep blue sea, go snorkeling or just lie on the beach. Lying on the beach is very relaxing and it is the perfect thing to do on vacation. Once the sun goes down, I would hit the bars to have some drinks and enjoy the nightlife. And I would always have my meals at some luxurious restaurants. This is the kind of dream vacation I want so bad. Vacations should be relaxing, not tiring.\n  There are always the differences between a real vacation and a dream vacation. And it is all on account of the budgets we have. Once I have enough money, I will have my dream vacations come true. From now on, I will save my money to turn all my vacations into my dream vacations.\n",

  "text": "\nThere has never been a bigger force for change than technology, it changes absolutely everything about the way we live, even the way we talk with each other. Despite the rise of social media, the idea of community has changed radically, because people are sharing interests everywhere on the planet. Social Media such as Twitter, Facebook, Youtube and blogs illustrate surely that the definition or repercussion of digital technologies is created through the forms in which they are worn and the social relations and associations that expand around them. This essay will discuss the implications of social media for everyday life, emphasizing the problems which arose with the use of Facebook and Twitter. Finally it will look into possible future implications of this kind of technoogy.\n\nSocial networks websites can be explained as a web usefulness that admit people to create a public or semi-public profile, arrange a list of other contacts which is possible to share connection and look and cross their list of connections and those made by others within the system. Namen and Kinnison (2012) indicates that “the three types of social interactions that social networking enables include (1) creaction of an online identity, (2) establishment of relationships between users, and (3) development of layered communities defined by the lists of connections each user establishes”. One of the most popular social networking websites is Facebook. Another rapidly expanding social networking is Twitter. These kinds of websites allows people to interact with others precisely by smartphones or computers. By Twitter, users post opinions or comments narrow to 140 characters. On the other hand, on Facebook people can share pictures, vídeos and thoughts without restrictions.\n\nAs a result of an appropriate use of social networking tools in education, Javanovic, Chiong and Weise (2012) demonstrate that students adopt Facebook not especially for socialising but also for academic purposes, like to obtain benefit for their studies or to recover time in discovering learning resources (p.39). Furthermore, some departments of police in the USA used Facebook to share a vídeo of a felony with the expectancy to identify the suspects and their followers were apt to say something about the incident in return to the publication. Additionally, a politician from Philadelphia, USA was elected after take advantage of his Twitter account appropriately during his campaign.",

  "text": "My most memorable learning experience to date was my marriage. My ex-husband taught me not to be involved with some kind of people by analyzing his behavior before commitment.\nDuring our dating he was very charming and attentive. We discussed about some sexist ideas that I don't agree with what the society demands on people and I noticed a little sexism of him, but I was fine with that because That can happen, but due to my profession he couldn't be like that for so long because I was in a man's shoes. He was very jealous but I thought it would fade away with time and with the gaining of the trust but it did not and ended up making me sick by the time passed.\nI learned that a man does anything to conquer a woman, he even does a lot of hateful things for him such as going to her home every night to stay together or to hang out, while later you find out that he hates going to places except his house. I learned a man says anything just to shut you up and not discuss just to have some love moments. He does not end an argument and give a position to understand your point, he thinks he is right and does not want to think about it.\nI also learned that men think in a different way from the women during the day. For example, while women think about millions things like what they want to do or have to do during the day, while men just do nto think about anything and can be like that for hours, just whith a blank mind. But in my opinion this should be an excuse to think something that women shouldn't know anything about.\nI also learned that is the mother that gives the principles and the direction of a man's mind, and depending on her he is going to be a sexist or not, he is going to help and be an honor man or not, he is going to be a good and caring father or not, he is going to be a responsible human being or not. A mother is very fundamental and the basis for the men principles and beliefs. Women do not knoe their importance for the future on their own homes. They teach the same things over and over again and do not rethink if those beliefs and actions are really right to help the world change and be a better world for everyone.",

Everyone lived peacefully and harmoniously until one day, at the welcoming ball in honour of the  little princess, a horrendous witch showed up and cursed the little princess named Sophie, who would die at the age of 16 and only a kiss of true love would save her.\nPrincess Sophie grew up, she was so unhappy because she couldn't do anything, she was condemned to live in a room of the castle until someone could find the cure for her cursed. One day she figured out how to escape through a hidden passage, she got to the town and ran and jump, she did every little thing she wasn't aloud to since so long. While she was having some fun, a handsome boy crashed her and she fall to the ground. As only a gentleman would do, he apologised and introduced himself to the Princess:\n- I am so sorry Madam, excuse me for my blunder. I am Michael.\nThe princess was a little scared of talking to someone she didn't know, because she never got to talk to anyone before, but still she answer him with a big smile-You are excused, my name is Sophie.- It truly was love at first sight. Michael asked her to go with him for an ice cream so he could amend his fault.\nSophie accepted and they started a strong friendship that through the time became in more than just a friendship, they fall in love for each other. \nPrincess Sophie used to escape so she could meet with Michael, until one day, when she was  just about to meet Michael to confess him all the truth about who she really was, a guards discovered her and the King commanded to lock her up in her room.\nMichael was disappointed because he thought that Princes Sophie didn't love him anymore. Princess Sophie send him a lot of letters telling him the truth about her, and about her cursed. But after Michael read the first letter, and found out that Sophie was a princess, he thought he was just a game for her.\nHe didn't want to read the next letters, in which Princess Sophie said he was the love of her life and also wrote about the curse. Michael decided to leave the kingdom, when he was just about to close the door he turned back to his coffee table and saw the letters, he had a hunch but he ignored it.\nMichael closed the door and knew at that moment he has made a mistake.",

We need to consider a lot of factors before we can make a judgement of this kind. What happens in future will be decided by what happens now. We have already heard about how pollution is killing our planet earth, gradually. People are advised to carpool and travel to work places. Several announcements over radio and  TV emphasize the need to use the public transport system for travelling to save nature. Yet, not many pay heed to the message. People may choose to ignore the advice now but in future they may not have a choice.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before we reach a tipping point with respect to the limited natural resources that we have. Then we may have no choice but to use public transport as much as we can for travel.  ",

There are family problems, football madness, romantic obsessions and mental illnesses. \n\nThe plot is about a young man (Bradley Cooper) who has just been  discharged from a psychiatric hospital  and has moved  to his parents home. He was accused of mistreating his wife and that is the reason why they had been separated for  the last eight months. The problem is that he has an obsession: he wants  to get back with his wife although  he can't talk to her as the police have forbidden him.  His neighbour is a young woman ( Jennifer Lawrence) who has been widowed for 2 years. She has  a turbulent and complicated past. They meet   by chance and started a  tortuous relationship  as  friends.  Interestingly, they find the way to help each other and not surprisingly  finally they fall in love. \n\nI personally think that the film transmit an interesting view  of the psychiatric illnesses and the importance of the family in this type of problems.

  "text": "Introduction\nThe aim of this report is to present young people's interests in my country. It gives information about their tastes in music, TV programmes and clothes.\nMusic\nA revival of rock music has been seen in the past 10-15 years. So, naturally, about half of the teenagers and young adults prefer rock and roll, hard rock and progressive rock to other genres. They enjoy both local bands' production and some foreign songs. About one third of the rest would claim they listen mainly to pop folk, whereas the rest would be interested in R&B, soul and jazz.\nTelevision\nAlthough not many young people like spending their free time watching TV, I believe that some patterns of preference can still be recognized. Except classics like Friends, popular shows include How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang and the new HBO talk show Last Week Tonight. I can say with high certainty that reality TV is no more in with young people in my country.\nClothes\nMost teens tend to create their unique style, often managing to start a fashion of their own. Designer clothes are not what they look for anymore. \nConclusion\nThis information can help the organizers of next year's festival in choosing appropriate music and catering to a variety of tastes.",

We regulary organise film projections and discussions around a subject related to the film. We also invite guest speakers and organise fun events.\n\nBenefits for the students\n\nMany students gain a great deal from our activities. For example, with every film seen our students have the chance to practice their language and to develop their own opinions, particularly as we always have discussions aroud a subject related to the film. Also our monthly speakers are exellent, for example, last year we invited a well-known actrice, Janet Hewitt, to share some of her experience on Broadway. Unfortunalety, organising this kind of events is costly and the money from membership fees is not enough.\n\nBenefits for the college\n\nWe also believe the college benefits from our Club. Being founded in 1920 by our well-known alimni, John Carter, the English Language Club is the oldest club in our college.

  "text": "1. The author compares Easter to a pagan spring festival, because they are associated with happiness. The way Easter and specifically Good Friday is celebrated is gradually deprived of religious content. People don't want to to contemplate Christ's suffering, but they want to move directly to the cheerful part of Easter celebration, so to Easter Sunday. \n2. According to the author, people \"flinch from consideration of Good Friday\" due to three taboos connected with this day:self-sacrifice, suffering and death. The way self-sacrifice is seen has changed enormously - we no longer want to sacrifice ourselves, because it's unpopular and it is in contradiction with the idea of consumerism. What is more, we are becoming indifferent to other people's suffering and that's why we aren't willing to think about it, even on Good Friday. Suffering as well as death is pushed away from our real life - we don't want to experience them but rather watch it on different kinds of TV shows.  \n3. L'Oreal slogan \"Because you're worth it\" proves the author's thinking that we are unwilling to sacrifice ourselves. In a consumptive lifestyle  we want more and more for ourselves, but not for other people, because it will require self-sacrifice.",

  "text": "Nowadays, it is hard for many young people to do physical exercise frequently. It is a well-known fact that sometimes they prefer watching TV on the sofa or playing computer games comfortably to doing physical activities. So, it is necessary to find a solution in order to make young people keep fit in a motivated way.\n\nThere can be no doubt that technology should be a tool to motivate young people.  It is clear that most of them use computers and watch television almost every day, but while they are doing this they are sitting in a comfortable sofa. I feel very strongly that computer games could be an enjoyable way to do physical exercise without going out of home. In the market, you can find a wide range of computer games or video games to keep fit, such as dancing to the rhythm of last hits, playing tennis, doing aerobics, running...\n\nMoreover, schools can play an  important role in kids' fitness. It is true that many young people do extra activities related to sports like football or basketball. Although some schools offer the chance of doing these, many others do not do. I firmly believe that were the schools to offer kids a greater variety of sports, there can be no doubt that they would do more exercise. In this way, children could do the sport they prefer as a routine.\n\nTo sum up, it is important motivating the young people to do physical exercise. School programmes and technology could be effective methods to achieve this goal. It seems to me that school programmes would make young people be encouraged to keep fit because in this way, they do their favourite sport in a routine way. ",

  "text": "   It all started with jumping over the big black trashcans. I was 9 years old when it happened for the first time. Back in the time, when I successfully passed the third grade, my parents decided to let me pick the present that I want as a reward. The very first thing came to my mind was a pair of inline roller skates; I used to look out of my window, or sitting on my house’s door step and see my neighbors skating and trying to do some tricks and jumps, and all I wanted was joining them instead of watching them enjoying their times. My parents took me to TOYS R US to get what I wanted. I ran to the outdoor toys section and I picked the skate I liked. I tried couple of sizes to see which one fits more. I could not be more excited to join my friends. After that, I went back home, I put them on, and I went outside to skate. I fell over a hundred times in a few days. By the time, I got better, and I started to learn how to do tricks and jump over small items. While skating was a whim for my friends and me in the beginning, I found myself in it. I knew that skating is the thing I want to do for the rest of my life, the thing I want to tell people about when they ask me what your favorite thing to do is. \n        In a couple of years, I became much better and I learned to do many tricks like skating backwards, the Snake and the Zigzag. I learned how to jump over many items, such as chairs and the trashcans that my neighbors used to jump over. However, that was not enough for me. I kept trying to know more about skating. I entered middle school; I met two friends who also love to skate, Mohammed and Khalid. We decided to go skating on the next weekend at the park, which has a wide walk path by the sea. When we met on the weekend, I noticed that they were different; they have different skates, and different methods of skating, they slid on edges and skated on the park benches. I realized that this is what I am looking for, a new additional excitement to add to skating. I had to wait for two months to buy a new pair of skates, but this time it is aggressive skates. \n       When I started aggressive skating, I had to learn how to balance my weight using heavy two-wheel inline skates. This kind of skating taught me how to take risks and not to be afraid. After a while, the group expanded, and we used to go around the town, Yanbu, to search for great edges and rails to slide on. In addition, we made our own skate rails, and we used some help from my friend’s brother, who is in fact an Engineer. \n        Once on a weekend, it was my last year in middle school, I was at the park practicing as usual. I found three people skating, and again, a new kind of skates, and new methods. Their moves were so smooth; it was more like a ballet. I was impressed. I introduced myself, and as I thought, they were vising from a different city. We discussed different topics, but mainly skating. The more we get deep into the conversation, the more I want to learn this type of skating. It turned out that they were wearing roller hockey skates. “These skates are light, smooth, and perfect for freestyle slalom skating.” One of them said. The words “freestyle” and “slalom” caught my attention. They showed me what slalom skating is. They started to put small cones in one line with a bit of space in between. They played some music and started to skate with the rhythm. I was surprised, I had mixed feeling, and it was indescribable. I kept staring at them with wide opened mouth and eyes. The butterfly feeling in my stomach started to appear. I knew at that moment that I want to change my style of skating. \n\n        However, as the skaters suggested, I bought a pair of hockey skates. I did not have the ability to order the cones online back then, therefore, I went to IKEA, and bought small colored cups and used it as cones. I went to the same park. After couple of hours of trying to get used to my new skates, I put the cups on. I opened some tutorial videos on YouTube and started to practise. In a short time, I became so good, and some of my friends changed from aggressive to slalom skating just by seeing me practicing. My guess is they had the same reaction I had when I saw the three skaters. \n       For me, skating is not just a sport. After almost 3 years of practicing to do tricks, to create a perfect match between my moves and the rhythm of the song I am playing, and to try to reach the perfection, I realized that slalom skating is more like a performing art than a sport. A freestyle skater who can make a perfect combo of tricks that matches the rhythm is an artist. When I stopped looking for enthusiasm, fun, and excitement and started trying to fulfill my heart, brain, and body’s desires by skating, I knew for sure skating is not just a sport or a hobby. Skating is a lifestyle. \n     About one year ago, I moved to Philadelphia, United States. Unlike weather in my country, Philadelphia is always rainy, wet, and sloppy. This weather was an obstacle, it was impossible to skate in this condition. However, I was not going to give up on skating that easy. I had to find something to keep me going, to fulfill the missing part in me. A friend suggested giving ice skating a shot, and for me, everything worth trying just to be able to skate again. I went to an ice rink, I rented hockey skates, and I started to skate. I did not imagine that it would be that similar to roller skating. What I learned in 10 years, I had the ability to learn it on ice in one month. It was just a matter of balance. \n     Today, After 10 years of skating, I wonder sometimes what my life would be without skating. I believe that skating is a huge part of me, Mohammed, and I am positive that if this part was missing, my path in life would have changed and I will never be the same person I am now. \n",

  "text": "Advertising is a form of communication that is used to influence and persuade consumers to buy products, services, ideas. Advertising is most commonly aimed at the manipulation consumer's behavior in a commercial aspect. But at the same time advertising has many features in common with art.\n\nFirstly, art is the expression of  human creative skills and imagination, typically in a visual form. And advertising is a combination of sounds, images and words. Like art it is intended to evoke emotions and feelings. To be successful advertising often uses images from popular movies, catchy melodies, unusual graphic elements and fragments of famous paintings. Often people, who are watching a commercial, do not remember what details or elements of other visual art types they have seen before. Therefore, advertising successfully combines other types of art to influence the subconscious and human behavior.\n\nSecondly, art as well as advertising is such a large part of our everyday lives. Someone designed all things around: a chair, shoes, clothes. It is art. Art is something that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing to people’s eyes. Hoardings and billboards, which are a part of the urban landscape, are art. Visual advertising like painting uses color, value, space and line. There are elements of art. Also it uses balance, contrast, emphasis and proportion. There are principles of design.\n\nLastly, advertising like art originated a long time ago. Commercial advertising can be traced as far back as Ancient Greece. There were posters for entertainment, small ads for businesses, merchants used town criers, paying for events. With the development of mass media, television and Internet advertising has become the strongest form of communication. Now advertising is a big part of modern culture. \n\nAdvertising has similarities with the art and often combines other types of art to be more successful. Advertising is creative combinations of sounds, images and words. Modern technologies, the development of mass media are allowed advertising to become the greatest art from the 20th century.",

It consists of eight part: Introduction; How to start; Writing the play; I want to be Cinderella; Practise; The big night; Reason for doing a play and A few final thoughts. The author says that the pros far outweigh the cons and it is the main idea of the article. The first thing you need to start with is a deadline to get everything done by. Writing the play: first, you may ask learners to invent profiles and to tell you about their characters; second, learners can write the basic outline of the play or you can adapt a familiar story.\nThey you should take a decision of choosing roles: start by asking for volunteers; and always ensure that everyone in the class has a role or something to do. Students must learn their lines by heart. The most effecnive way is to practise every lesson for ten minutes at the beginning and end. You can give them the play with gaps to read through and finally get them to perform a number of times without a script. Some learners will not want a spiaking part, you can even ask them to be promters. Reasons for doing a play: learners will learn whole chunks of language in a clear context and they will learn not only their parts. It gives learners the opportunity to demonstrate different their skills at the language classroom. Also they can see how much language they can produse.",

  "text": "In a world of increasing environmental awareness improved public transport represents the way of the future. Although people do enjoy the convenience and privacy of travelling in their own private vehicles, in my opinion they may choose public transport if it fulfils certain conditions. These conditions fall into three broad categories: attitudinal, financial and logistical.\nFrom an attitudinal perspective, people must first be convinced of the benefits of public transportation. An educational or public relations campaign must be launched to sensitize those who might have disregarded this possibility before. People should be familiarized with the environmental, social and personal benefits for present and future generations. This is one step.\nFrom a financial perspective, public transportation must be a clear and viable benefit to consumers. In other words, it must be more affordable than driving to work every day. For example, if people know that by using bus and subway, they can save enough money to take a free holiday each year, many more individuals would be persuaded to travel in this way. This is another critical step.\nFrom a logistical perspective, public transportation should be convenient for commuters. City planners and transport officials must ensure that frequent and reliable public transportation is available for each citizen. For people to make the habit of travelling by bus or subway, they must know that they will be able to get to various places on time. Transport vehicles must be well maintained, subway and bus drivers should be customer-oriented and service must be punctual and efficient. This is an additional important step.\nIn conclusion, through a multi-pronged approach, it is possible to increase the use of public transportation. City officials and politicians can lead the way by utilizing these forms of transport themselves and bringing about change through personal example. Then, more citizens will follow suit and we may all hope to live in a cleaner, less polluted environment.",

  "text": "My favorite sport is cycling.\nI enjoy this sport because it allows you to take care of your health by using almost all your muscles while you can also enjoy the scenery and visit the places you come across. Like every sport, it is also a good way to meet people and make some new friends. You can ride at your own pace and go increasingly far. It makes you see the road and your environment differently. Furthermore, it is better for the planet to ride a bike instead of a car because cycling doesn't produce any pollution.\nWhen you start riding a bicycle, you first need to check if your bike follows the security instructions. For instance, you need good brakes, lights, a bell and reflective stripes on your wheels or reflectors. You also need to know some basic rules such as putting out your arm to indicate when you turn and of course, you need to know the highway code. A lot of people are afraid to ride a bike in cities because they fear the massive presence of cars and think they will be crushed. Indeed, some places still need to improve the structures for bikes: sometimes they don't have a lot of bicycle paths. But if you learn how to obtrude in the circulation while remaining polite with the others, there is no reason to be afraid.\nLet's get on our bikes and discover new places!",

It looked quite simple, I had no idea who could have sent me that letter. When the woman left, I opened it eagerly and when I read the first sentence my heart stopped. It was from the most dangerous and terrifyng gang of the village. It said that I was now one of them.\nI met those boys next Friday and they told me that I had to pass the test initiation.\n\n\nI felt extremely nervous, I was about to commit a crime and my heart was beating uncontrollably, really fast. I went into the tiny shop and the shop keeper looked through me.\n\n“Hi”, he groaned drumming his fingers.\n\n“Do you have ice-creams?” I asked nervously.\n\nThe shop keeper nodded and pointed at a grey fridge at the end of the shop.\n\n“Thank you”, I mumbled and went straight to the fridge. My hands were sweating and the other boys were waiting outside ecstatic.\n\nA second later a child entered the shop and began to move around quickly. He was quite small, about seven years old and he was beaming, smiling from ear to ear. \n\nI thought it was the perfect moment and at the speed of light I put a whole box of sweets into my old bag. Silence. I walked forwards and stared at the shop keeper. I was going to leave when the bitter and loud voice of the man surprised me.\n\n“Hey little boy, what are you doing? He yelled angrily.\n\nMy heart nearly stopped beating. I turned and noticed that the man was not speaking to me, but to the child.\n\n“ I don´t know”, he answered confused.\n\n“Where has the sweet box gone little thief? He rasped and crossed his arms.\n\n“I have not taken anything yet”, the boy whimpered.\n\n“Dear me! How can you be so cheeky?” he uttered dismissively taping his feet. \n\nThe boy began to mourn. After watching this, I returned to my house hoping the man forgives the child. Feeling horribly guilty, I fell asleep. \nThat was the first crime I comited and here I am now, in jail.\n",

And we can find different reasons to be interested in this type of events.\n\nI think that horse races are a fun entertainment if you like one of these three things: animals, betting and fashion. If you like animals you'll ejoy seeing that beautiful horses running and vaulting as fast as they can.\nIf you like to bet and you're not used to doing at horse races, maybe you're looking forward to trying to bet on the nose or each way.\nAnd if you love fashion and you have the chance to go to Ascot, you may run into the Queen and greet her, and at the same time enjoy the fabulous view of all those extravagant hats the ladies wear. Meanwhile you can have a good time drinking some bubbly.\n\nBut you can also have a \"horrible\" day at the races: if  you're not savvy enough to know the differences between the bets, you can end up skint, penniless. And of course, if you're not an it-girl, you can spend a lot of money and choose a wrong dress to attend Ascot and perhaps you'll have to view the races from behind a curtain.\n\nAnyway, if you knew beforehand your odds of winning it wouldn't be so thrilling. That's the raison d'être of horse racing: lose or win money. And if you want to admire the wonderful world of hats, you'd better buy some magazine where you'll find all the photos for just 2€",

  "text": "Hello,\n\nthanks for the letter which has just arrived. I´ve read that you´re writing a term paper on the chances of developing counties to profit from the electronic revolution, are you? I think I´ve some useful information for you. Because two days ago I´ve read an article, by Nadine Bös, about this topic. The text was about the possibility to transfer money with mobile phones in developing countries.\nAt first you have to know that the technical term for this is \"mobile banking\". Today it is fact that there is a target group for mobile banking: people who are living in remote areas of the world. On the one hand there are hardly any banks in these regions, so they don´t have access to bank services. But on the other hand the number of mobile phones has risen. So now the most important factor is that mobile nets are reaching the remotest areas in the world. Through this many people would have access to mobile banking and in addition to that it makes money available so it can be used in shops. According to Hannah Dideck the largest potential is that migrants con use mobile banking to send money home.\n\nI hope I could help you with this information. Write back soon and let me know how it goes.\n\n\nBest wishes\n\nAlexandra",

  "text": "For today's teenagers it is hard to imagine life before mobile phones although it did exist only some decades ago. Few technical inventions have had such a deep impact on our daily life as this little thing .\nHowever, there are various advantages and disadvantages to a mobile phone and everyone has to decide for him- or herself in which way to use this medium. \nFirst of all, the mobile phone is a great way to \"stay connected\" all the time. Chatting with your friends, staying informed of the latest news, ordering online, etc - you can do all these things simultaneously, wherever and whenever you want. This aspect has also enabled employees to become homeworkers as they do not longer need to be present in an office to get a job done. Furthermore mobile phones allow last-minute-changes very easily. No need to make a fixed appointment with a friend in advance, as you can always agree to call each other once everyone is on the way.\nHowever, the biggest strength of the mobile phone is also the biggest risk in my opinion: being connected all the time creates a lot of stress for people, as you are always available for everyone. Therefore you don't have any time to relax, which is essential, even from your leisure duties. The same is valid for business life: if employees are available all the time, they take the worries of the daily business with them to their home which means a lot of stress. Last but not least, the mobile phone enables worried parents or suspicious partners to track the child or the loved one nearly permanently. This can be seen as loving worry about someone but also as a sign of distrust. \nFinally,  the mobile phone offers both disadvantages and advantages in daily life. However, I personally think that it should not be regarded too critically but should only be handled responsably, according to one's personal needs. ",

It is obligatory for the inhabitants to put their different types of garbage into separate bins. Although citizens usually obey those rules, in some cases they are completely neglected. However, people who have bigger houses tend to compost the organic waste and that makes up for the disobedient. The situation with household litter looks much better rather than what happens on the streets of the city. Waste is thrown on the ground and very few people are concerned about this problem.\n\nTown's actions\n\nAs not all inhabitants are sensitive about the environment, it is the local government's responsibility to decrease the harmful effects of people's actions. Authorities make sure that rubbish bins are placed in small distances since this is the most common reason why people throw litter on the ground. There are many workers employed so that the waste is picked up. Not also does it give job to people, but also has a good impact on the town's scenery.",

  "text": "One of the most challenging issues in modern cities is transportation. Cities have been planned to satisfy people's needs to travel all around the city. Now we can observe people moving around the city using bikes, underground, public transport, and cars. Although there are many people who suggest that public transport is no longer a suitable option because cars are considered a more convenient option to transport, there are more benefits using public transport than travelling by car, such as reduction of traffic, saving money, and decreasing of pollution.\n\nFirstly, a car could carry only 5 people at a time. A bus or an underground wagon can carry from 30 to 100 people at a time. When referring to cars, we can considerably reduce the number of vehicles on the streets if we use public transport. The less we use cars, the less traffic we shall see in the roads. Secondly, having a car implies different costs to be afforded. For example, cars require petrol to function. If a person constantly uses his/her car, he/she shall need to pay for more petrol. Equally important, a car requires maintenance and it shall be another expense that the owner has to cover. Finally, if every person drives his/her own car, pollution shall considerably increase affecting air conditions.",

  "text": "With any new course, there are some certain expectations one will have. At the beginning of this course, as a first year postgraduate student, I was ambitious for creating a new mechanical product or at least part of it at the end of this course by applying knowledge and skills that are provided throughout the course.\n\nEight months working in the industry as an assistant mechanical design engineer gave me the very basic concept of mechanical design. Before taking part in this course, my concept about mechanical design was about applying either self knowledge or working as a part of a team to design mechanical products that are easy to be manufactured, durable and financial reliable. My thoughts about mechanical design were somewhat match with the information that is provided in the first three weeks.\n\nBy attending the first three lectures, I soon realized that my general concept about mechanical design is quite simple as my thoughts about mechanical design is purely just creating new products. I recognized that mechanical design is not just about creating mechanical products. It can be seen in many aspects ranging from producing a maintenance process, improving performance for a specific part of the mechanical system to creating the whole new product. This is because despite having experience in industrial design, I was never taking part in the design process from the initial stage. Therefore, my knowledge about mechanical design is rather limited. \n\nBeing placed in a project team working for Sydney Water about producing a maintenance excellent standard, I started to read the course outline and lecture notes more carefully to find out where to start and what I should do to deliver a good outcome. The first thing I have noticed is the importance of clarifying all the requirements with the clients. This was demonstrated during the Project Introductions session as well as lecture notes, client interview task and client feedback (which is worth 25 points in the total mark). As soon as I met my group, I discovered how far behind I am in terms of using English to demonstrate the ideas and lure the attention from other group members. However, this also is an opportunity to meet up and work with them every week, whose English is their first language, to improve my oral communication skills and persuasion. Because in order to deliver a successful industry project, I not only have to make a good product, but also have to be good at introducing my idea and persuading customers. The final consideration is the self-calibration, which also is the point that I have never considered before in a design process. This is such an essential activity that allows me to gauge my performance, keep pace with the group and not to be left behind.\n\nTo sum up, at the end of week three, my expectation for this course are to be able to apply my reflective thinking in any further design process, to be able to deliver a persuasive technical presentation, to be effective in verbal communication skills and presentation skill. Last but not least, I hope I can learn to work effectively under any circumstances as a team member or a team leader by the end of this course.\n",

  "text": "In recent years, many regions of the world have faced an issue about water scarcity that may affect their development, especially for those countries undergoing poverty. Due to the increasing population of the world, countries are likely to need more fresh water to irrigate crops to satisfy their population. Therefore, water scarcity may pose a threat to people’s living standards. This essay will analyse the problem of water scarcity in Australia and recommend some viable alleviation solutions. It will examine responses including the recycling water, the development of technology about purifying ocean water and multinational sharing about water resources.\n\nRecycling wastewater is an effective method to solve water scarcity problem. This is because there is a huge number of water usage presenting in people’s daily life, they just need to be collected to filter waste parts. However, the use of recycled water for daily routine is less common, because many people are repelled by the thought of water that comes from our toilets or drains. For example, those recycled water can be utilized to water plants in a garden, but if they are clear enough, residents only need to heat them to wash dishes or even drink. Thus, states should make it possible to purify the wastewater to an enough safety level.\n\nMoreover, developing latest technology about purifying ocean water can be regarded as a viable alleviation strategy. As is well known, about 70 per cent surface of earth is covered by ocean water, so every region surrounded by ocean like Australia makes the most of ocean water resource to release the pressure of fresh water need. Although, governments are likely to face economic stress initially, which means they have to invest more money into upgrade technology instead of other field such as education, infrastructure and medical care, this strategy could affect dwellers’ physical health and promote their living standard.\n\nSharing different water resources with neighbouring countries can be another strategy which can help to alleviate the problem of water scarcity. Countries with abundant resources can give assistance to nations with water scarcity. In this way, those states of drought regions will obtain enough time and technical aid to overcome water problems. Despite over shared water resources could lead to violence and even international tension, few countries suffered these problems.\n\nIn conclusion, water shortage has presented a challenge to individual life and global environment. This essay has discussed three alleviation strategies with the potential to resolve the problem of water scarcity, including the use of recycled water and ocean water and international aid. While these approaches are likely to solve the problem partially, they might have a positive impact on water shortage in a long term.\n",

  "text": "Nowadays we watch the perfection of actors all over the world. The range of techniques they use to strike the audience is colossal. Facial expression is said to be more important for the film actors,  whereas body language and voice intonation are paid more attention to in the stage acting. Besides, camera work, props and special effects deserve to be called silver screen features, while staging implies actors to convey their play through body movements and energy.\nIt is evidently that those types of acting are different and the actors should adapt to the conditions they work in in one way or another. But let’s take a closer look at what performance capabilities they have and might use during the acting. The stage actor is armed with props, costumes and light as well as the film actor. The only preponderance of film acting versus stage acting is in camera/editing work and special effects. But those are justified by the presence effect stage actors might render active in comparison to film actors. So I would say those types of acting are even in the sense of external factors.\nRegarding acting techniques, stage actors do use their body languages as much as film actors. The only thing that differs is that film actor has several takes opposed to stage actor who has to play perfectly at one dash. And controlling your voice is also important for the film actors, in spite of having the support of audio operators, they still have to deal with the same problems as stage actors that is keeping your voice expressions in compliance with the acting, resonate moving, communicate emotions and feelings of their model character.\nThe key point is that the whole range of techniques makes that acting pieces perfect. I would say, it doesn’t matter are you performing on the stage or in front of the camera, you should use your facial expression, body language, intonation and timber of voice as if you’re acting as your main character, embody all their treats and features appropriately to the situation. In other words, no matter what kind of performance it is, the only thing that matters is using all your abilities to model yourself on your hero, get the feel of their role.",

However the first article was more motivating to read, because the author substantiated important suggestions. All I can say about the second article is that it has rarely proof of the intervention.\nFirstly, the article ‘predicting dyslexia – even before children learn to read’  shows a new research,  in which it’s possible to pick up some of the signs of dyslexia in the brain even before kids learn how to read. In addition, using this identification may assist parents, educators and clinicians to tackle the learning disorder. Most importantly, this early intervention can help many kids with dyslexia to overcome  their educational failure . \nSecondly , the article ‘'Innovative' Intervention Helps Babies at High Risk of Autism’  is based on a video-therapy, which improves the interaction between parents and autism-related babies in a way that would help develop the children’s communication abilities and social engagement. In my opinion, the findings need to be replicated in larger studies before other people turn to video-based therapy as a potential treatment. What I can tell from this text is that the research is an innovative idea, but needs more attention to improve their success.\nAll in all, if you want to read about an effective research with very strong proposals, I recommend reading  ‘predicting dyslexia – even before children learn to read’.\n",

  "text": "Brands ¬ pay more for better quality?\n\nWe all know the situation, when we are in supermarket standing in front of two products which are the same, but one of it costs much more than the other. Here we have brand products and no name products.\nNow the question is, if it is really justified that brand products are much more expensive than no name products.\n\nMost people associate brand products automatically with higher quality or better taste, while they think no name products are just cheap and without any quality and a bad taste.\nIn surveys, it was asked if consumers would rather buy brand products or no name products. Most of the consumers said, they would buy brand products. When they were asked why, they answered with \"because it tastes better\".\nAfter that the consumers made a blind taste test. The product without brand tasted better to nearly everybody.\n\nAs a result you can say it is not always justified that brand products are more expensive than comparable other ones. Only the brand and the good marketing makes it that expensive, not better quality or better taste. The effect of media on people is clearly noticeable here. A product which everybody is talking about and which is advertised a lot is automatically considered to be good. It is like \"Everybody has it, I need it too!\"\nIn some cases it may be true that brand products are better than no names, for example technology products, but products like Red Bull or others like that, are definitely not always better.\n\nBrand and good quality are not always the same. Here it is said, try and find out which is really the better one and do not trust on advertisements. \n",

We had won three free plane tickets to Rome in a competition, and we were looking forward to our trip for months. But, unfortunately, we had forgotten to get a passport for our son, so Pedro couldn’t fly. Luckily, we had arrived very early for our flight, so we still had time to do something about it. We ran to the police station in the airport to apply for an emergency passport. My wife went with Pedro to the photo machine while I was filling in the forms. The passport was ready in an hour, so we were hurrying to the gate and got on the plane.",

You'll need to take the underground from the airport to the central train station. The underground it's in the airport and it's very easy to reach because you just have to follow the signs. You have to take the trains going towards the centre of the town and when you are on the train, jump off at the stop called \"Stazione Centrale\". Once you're in the train station, go where they sell tickets and buy one for Viterbo. Get the train and jump off at the \"Viterbo\" stop - I will be right out of the station waiting for you!\nIn this period it's mostly sunny and warm, but in the evening it gets a little cold and windy so bring some jumpers or sweaters...\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you!\nSee you soon!",

Otherwise, the place would turn into a mess, especially the crowded places.\n\nIt may seems boring and time wasting to wait in queues, but it isn't. Actually, it is time saving because everyone eventually does what he wants without wasting time pushing other people. In addition, employees don't get confused by receiving several requests at the same time. That saves time because they receive each request only once and in an organised manner. Also, that make them do their jobs efficiently.\n\nAlso, some people would never do what they want without queues. Old people and other weak people wouldn't be able to push and fight to get their turn. That would make them feel disabled.\n\nBeing crowded in front of the employee makes people uncomfortable. First, they wouldn't have privacy because there would be many people surrounding the one dealing with the employee. In addition, everyone would feel rushed to finish what he is doing.\n\nIn conclusion, people will do what they want smoothly and politely, if they wait patiently in queues.",

I saw this advertisement on a web site and I instantly thought it would be a really great experience for me to improve my English, but also a great way to show how responsible and caring I am. \nI love children and it wouldn't be annoying for me to take care of a group of little monsters and organize sports and activities for them, actually I think I would really enjoy it and my day would end up with a tired smile, but a very bright smile. I've never had any experience of this kind before, but I have a brother three years younger than me and a little cousin who's seven years old with whom I use to play a lot when I don't have to study. And, since it's a summer camp and I don't have homework to do, I would put all of myself into this job. I'm constantly brainstorming to find everything that could be challenging for me and I usually try to follow what my mind brings out, so I think I could come up with nice ideas for those children. \nI started cooking when I was fourteen years old, but I'm better at baking, so I could help preparing some sweets for children. They would obviously be as healthy as possible and I would be really careful about those children who have allergies, and try to bake something that also them can eat. \nI speak English quite fluently and I scored 95 points over 100 at both KET and PET certification. English is also my favorite language since I was a child, I started studying it at the age of three with a really nice teacher named Helen and I continued improving my English watching American movies and TV shows during the past few years.\nSo, I hope to be a great candidate for this job and to get on board with you.\nBest regards.\n",

  "text": "This year could be my last year... on Gotland :)\n\nFirstly I started a new job, it did not turn out they way I hoped unfortunately. My colleauges are nice but the management are terrible and recently I just stopped talking to them. Perhaps it is not their fault that this entire operation is so dysfuntional. Maybe they are, like myself, a bit in over their heads.\n\nBut the whole experience brought a positive surprise: working at the same school as Nora does is actually pretty nice. While we might talk about our job a bit too much I don´t think it is uncomfortable to work side by side.\n\nAnyhow. I finally connected with some people. I met some roleplayers at Wiscon and also some live roleplayers through Geek Network, of these the live roleplay looks promising. It is a steampunk story and I am supposed to be part of a secret society that is trying to stop an evil cult. It will be awesome!\n\nLastly I hope next year will bring some stability. While I do not wish top continue to work and live like this, I am not sure I want to move again. Moving is always upsetting and there is a period of adjustment that is very stressful. And a new workplace is difficult to adjust to and there is no promise that it will be better than the last. But I can´t imagine in can be as bad or worse then my current job.\n\nA thing I would miss is the connections I started forging with other people. If I move again I know it would take another year to find other people at least. Chances are that I won´t meet any other people because Visby at least has a few nerds that you can hook up with. I am not sure Vastervik has that kind of clientel.\n\nSo in conclusion I would like to say: the future is unknown. May I not live in interesting times.",

  "text": "By a wide definition, teachers are the people who teach you. For many people, parents are teachers in our life. However, are parents the best teachers in our life? Some people might agree with this statement, but I do not. I think the best teacher is a person who has professional knowledge and good teaching skills. In addition, the best teachers, by their teachings, are the people who we most agree with and appreciate. Many parents may not satisfy all of these conditions.\n\nFirst of all, for many parents to have professional knowledge or good teaching skills is very difficult. Most parents have special skills, but these skills may not be suitable for their children. Compared with professional teachers, they have specific teaching abilities. If parents want to get these abilities, they need to spend extra time to learn. Most parents are not willing to do so because of limited time. \n\nGood teaching skills are based on patience, training and passion. However, not all parents have that kind of personality and most of them are confused or use the wrong ways to teach their children.\n\nParents undoubtedly play an important role in our life. However, we may not be greatly influenced by their teachings, but by others’ teachings. Because everyone has their own talents, values, and judgments, we learn more from those with whom we agree and appreciate and get significant influence from them. These people can be deemed as the best teacher in our life, even if these people perhaps are not our parents. \n\nAlthough parents teach a lot of things in our life, because they don’t have professional training and we may not agree with them and learn more from them,   I think parents are not the best teachers in our life.\n",

  "text": "PREPARING THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE\n\nIf I could travel back in time, undoubtedly I’d choose to take part in the French revolution. The reason for my choice is simple and clear: the French revolution was the turning point in the European modern history and, thanks to its achievements, people in the twenty-first century can enjoy civil rights such as freedom of speech, assembly, worship and, the most important one, freedom of thought.\n\nIt is difficult to think about Paris without its Eiffel tower (it was built several years after the revolution), but I’m sure it was a gorgeous city as it is nowadays. I fancy its streets crowded by workers and peasants that have been called to support the revolution. They meet at midnight to listen to the speechs of the leaders. They trust in them, and are willing to fight for the freedom, fraternity and solidarity they proclaim.\n\nI also imagine aristocrats fleeing Paris at their earliest convenience, leaving all their expensive dresses and impressive houses unattended. They are frightened by the social movement, and prefer  to look for a safer shelter in the countryside.\n\nBut, if I could be there, I wouldn’t waste my time walking down the streets or laughing at the ridiculous aristocrats. I’d try to meet the poor king Louis the sixteenth and his wife, Marie Antoinette. I would do my best for making their imprisonment less hard and, above all, I’d try to convince the Parliament not to sentence them to the death penalty. Because no revolution is worthier than a human life.\n",

Thank you very much again for helping me getting the tickets for the concert in London but unfortunately I have bad news for you today. I was so excited about going to London and seeing you again. But only until yesterday! My professor told us that our final exam in this course would be on July 5th. As you know I'm not the best student and I've already failed in this exam twice, so there is only one more chance and I have to take it this semester. Otherwise I will be taken off the university register. To be honest I got really mad at him because I really wanted to go to London and I also already got tickets for my flight.\n\nYou don't know how ashamed I feel now, not only for you because you helped me to get the tickets (and I can imagine how difficult it must have been) but also because you have already arranged everything to make my stay in London as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. \n\nDo you maybe have a friend who you would like to go with to the concert since we can't go together? I would let you the ticket so at least you have the chance to enjoy that event even if it isn't with me. I'm sure it will be lots of fun going there! Otherwise I could sell both tickets and we can have a look if we want to go to the same concert here in Germany. The band is not so well known here and the ticket sale hasn't started yet.\n\nSorry again for all those circumstances!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nClaudia",

  "text": "I have been proving my abilities by overcoming arduous competitions since I chose this career as a lawyer and researcher complying with my passion in persuasion and problem solving. In 2002, I was ranked 11th amongst 930 candidates competing for 40 places at the University Federal of Paraiba. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my professional skills were recognized at the internships at the Federal Court of Law and the most famous fiscal law office in the State. At this period, I was the intern coordinator and I created a manual on the procedures employed by the entire Court. At the law office, I supervised the ISO 8003 procedures. On the other side, in recognition to my academic performance, I graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Great Honors in 2007. I was placed in the top 10 with a GPA of 8.73 out of 10. My bachelor thesis, founded in Economic Law, was unanimously awarded by the Jury with the maximum score of 10. This first success as a researcher contributed to my interest in global regulation of trade, that conduces me to this LLM and the international business transactions domain. \n\nSince my Law school graduation, many achievements encouraged my professional development. First, upon graduation, I immediately joined a highly recognized firm, performing a double role of legal consultant and sub-manager, when I was only 22 years old. On the same year, I succeeded the strenuous Brazilian Bar exam with a remarkable score of 9 out of 10. After almost 2 years working in complex litigation, I had acquired the maturity to pursue an international career to work within  and cross-border contracts. Therefore, in order to acquire the excellence extent demanded, I specialized in Economic law with a master’s degree at the University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne in 2009.   \n\nFollowing my LLM graduation with magna cum laude in the top five, I enrolled in a PhD in International Economic Law at the University Paris 9 Dauphine in 2010. Due to my interest in law and economics, I developed a multidisciplinary research applying the economic analysis in contemplation of illustrating the mutual influence of rules and economic transactions on the legal certainty of transnational transactions. I profoundly comprehend the theoretical ascertainment for this career, which is that international trade requires rational economic decisions with legally binding consequences. Thereby, new regulatory sources are created in response to the globalized legal context. In conclusion, as an international legal professional, I must be prepared for alternative methods of dispute resolution regarding cross-border transactions, giving the increasingly requirement to look beyond domestic law to find appropriate solutions. \n \nFurthermore, I already profoundly understand the importance of linguistics in an international sphere due to my experience as a foreign lawyer and as a teacher. Henceforth, I aim to consolidate my career by mastering the legal responses to the developments shaping international trade today. The LLM in International Business Regulation, Litigation and Arbitration at New York University is irrefutably the postgraduate program that I need to ensure the outcome aimed.\n",

Our specie has achieved great things, but despite all the great discoveries, there is still one problem we have not been able to suppress, a problem that has been haunting us since unmemorable times: racism.\nIn the 19th century, slavery had been eradicated from America, but soon another problem originated and took its place. The movie “The Color Purple” displays a variety of situations from Afro-American people who suffered because of their skin color, known as racism, which can be defined as the prejudice or discrimination from one race to another.  In this period of time, the Caucasian race felt superior to the Afro-Americans, they had the control and they were in charge of the political and economic activity, while the Afro- Americans did the hard work; as shown in the movie, most of the men where in charge of the crops. They did not have a chance to receive any kind of education at all, it was absolutely forbidden, and that is why they could not aspire to more important jobs.\nAfro-Americans were completely segregated, Caucasians found it impossible to live among them, that is the main reason why each race had their own church and their houses where separated to.\nAfro-Americans were afraid of raising their voices to express their inconformity against the oppression they were suffering, and to fight to obtain equality was not an option because any sign of rebellion was cruelly punished.\nMoreover, women in the Afro-American society where threatened in the most denigrating ways, men were the undisputed authority in the house. Women were in charge of the household chores, some of them could get a job as a servant of a Caucasian family.\nIt makes me feel sad to realize that racism is still a problem from which society suffers. I wonder, Why do we have the necessity of feeling superior to other people? We are all equal to God’s eyes, and I believe we all have the same right of living a peaceful life based on mutual respect.\n\n",

  "text": "Public transport is more useful and better than travelling by car. Many people would disagree, but our future depends on public transport.\nFirst of all, our environment is polluted and if we are determined to save it we should definitely stop using cars. Since cars produce exhaust fumes which slowly destroy our planet, we should start using public transport more often. Although there are many other polluters, such as big industries, people should start with the easiest resolutions.\nAlthough many countries do not offer a good public transport service, once people get rid of cars there will be more money for the improvements. For instance, Copenhagen and Vienna are good examples for this.  It seems like cars are losing the battle in this case because these cities propagate the idea that riding bicycles can lead to better future. As more money is being invested in the infrastructure, people tend to use more bikes and public transport.\nUnfortunately, not many people are prepared to renounce all the advantages car provides. For example, it is claimed that it is more convenient to travel by car than bus because you can make breaks whenever you want to and they are more spacious. Moreover, it is faster to travel by car than by any other public transport - planes are an exception to this rule.\nIn conclusion, I think that public transport should win this battle. It is a fight for the better and healthier future. The aforementioned representative examples of Vienna and Copenhagen prove how easy it can be to remove cars from our lives, and I believe that more cities should follow their examples.",

I understand that the new programme have some specific requisites  related to preservation of analysed samples. Nevertheless, all the information that I send to you is based on the information that my colleagues from wet chemistry laboratory and from microbiology laboratory gave to me. Of course that if you have any suggestions please tell me. I will transmit it to them and we will discuss them. \n\nSuppose that we have a stock failure resulting from an increasing demand of a particular analysis. Our international supplier won't be able to deliver the reagents or other goods on time. But we have a local supplier that could do it. Can we negotiate with them? What kind of deal can we do with local suppliers? I think it is important to have a local supplier that can help us in particular situations like a stock failure. International suppliers take, at least a week to deliver an order.\n\nThank you for this conversation. See you in a few days. ",

The Labrador really took him back to his engagement... Before the death of his dearest Mona. He was doing well despite his sad life. He fed on the frozen lasagna his mom had sent him a few days earlier.He exercised and went for short jogs in between workouts. His anxiety caught up to him every now and then but the good doctor had prescribed him a good remedy! Lost in his thoughts and unaware of what was going on around him, he heated the plastic bag filled with leftover food for Baxter. Suddenly Michael heard a thud from his upstairs bedroom, Called Baxter and took a bat with him upstairs. Michael rushed to his bedroom with a fatal mixture of fear and adrenaline in his system, only to see his box of pills on the ground and the sound of muffed but heavy breathing coming from behind the door. Michael closed the door,saw his dog gasping for air and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.",

  "text": "Thanks for sharing! I really enjoyed reading your blog about shadowing students. I like the way you gave examples how you felt and how you would change your own lessons. \nI live in the Netherlands and at our school it’s the same. Our pupils have to sit for many hours a day, and they find it hard to sit still and to be silent. I also think that a lesson went well if they didn’t talk and did their work. However, when I was reading your article I felt ashamed due to the fact that when every teacher teaches the way I do it is logical that our students can’t be quiet and can’t sit without making a move. Moreover, when we as teachers have a study day, I get tired myself by sitting all day.\nYour key takeaway №3 was shocking for me, the feeling of being a nuisance is dreadful. In my opinion I am very patient and willing to explain difficult topics over and over again. I really hope my students feel the same, otherwise I have to change my attitude! I get paid for being a teacher and , as I see it, it is my job to clarify and help my pupils to understand. \nYour experience gave me food for thought especially when you wrote that our pupils are sitting passively and listening during approximately 90 per cent of their classes. I am going to look at my lessons again to see if I can change those lessons and try to make my pupils active. I teach at Basisberoeps level and I have already started to use some activities were they must use an Ipad and make pictures or short films. For example, my pupils had to learn the difference between this and that and I let them make a short film about pointing at things in school saying: this door, that window, this is my teacher, that is a chair.                                                                            \nHowever, I find it difficult to use activities every lesson because they are time consuming. Although the main reason that prevents me from using them are my colleagues. I don’t see them doing activities, it looks as if they are just doing their lessons and want to use a book and that is it. For instance, when I hear that another English teacher finished Unit 5 and I am still at Unit 4  I feel incompetently. It gives me the feeling that most important of teaching is doing all the exercises in the book and getting all the work done. Maybe you understand this discrepancy between activate pupils and the pressure of the school board for the best test results. In other words, how can we convince school board and colleagues that it is better for pupils to learn in an active way?\n",

He stared at an object on the beside table, the object that could free him from this hell like existence. Thinking about it relieved him, made him feel excited about the unknown, the unexpected, maybe all the questions ever asked, maybe, finally, they would be answered. Could bliss we found in dead? Had he seen it all? Was it the best part life could offer? its own end?. A tear started running down his face as he looked at the clouds. The door was wide open, inviting him to take the offer.

My family knows most of my secrets, they know my worries and joys, they know that I am thinking about things.

  "text": "Nowadays, our environment is really affected by the great deal of progress that technology has made in the last century. As a result, some sources of energy like nuclear power are used for our daily life. But, is nuclear power good for us?\nLet’s begin by considering the arguments in favour. Huge amounts of energy are generated by nuclear reactors. Moreover, they only need a small quantity of fuel to be produced. Fossil fuels are our most common energy source, even though, they produced a terrible effect on global warming on account of releasing gases into the atmosphere. They won’t last forever and this will increase the use of nuclear energy. Just look at oil, nature takes millions of years to form it and we have almost ended it.\nLet’s turn to the arguments against. Nuclear power plants have a high risk of pollution in case of accident. In addition, they produce nuclear waste which is a major problem for the environment and public health. \nAll things considered, I believe that renewable energy will be the most common energy in the future as it doesn’t damage global warming although it is expensive to afford.\n\n\n",

  "text": "No, it is not rational because according to the economic theory, you should spend your money on those goods which yield the maximum utility per dollar. MUx/Px must equal MUy/Py. If MUx/Px is less than MUy/Py, than it is the consumer’s duty to buy more of good Y. If MUy/Py is less than MUx/Px, than the consumer must use more of good X. When you work more, you can consume more, each additional unit yielding additional, marginal utility, so you continually increase the sum of your total utility. Following the tradition of economic reasoning, more is better. She may be right about that treadmill because there is a cycle in which consumption results from work which necessitates further consumption, but theory would indicate that this is a positive, self-perpetuating cycle because increased consumption yields increased utility, therefore maximizing utility.\nThe book says that the rule to follow is to vary consumption until the marginal utility for every dollar for one thing that you are consuming is the same as the marginal utility for every dollar for another thing that you are consuming. Ms. Luhr’s dissatisfaction from her current status in our society must come from her failure to vary her consumption of a variety of material goods. For goods, the marginal utility may start to be less than it was before after a while, and then we are advised to switch our buying to other goods. Ms. Luhr needs to find the goods which work for her. Then she wouldn’t be talking about the negative aspects of work because it is work which allows her to consume and maximize her utility. Her utils are at their highest the more she consumes.\nIn my view Ms. Luhr is succumbing to her emotions rather than her logic because everyone knows that increased work yields increased wealth and increased utility, and this is the ultimate goal of a rational person who is acting selfishly which is how economists think people act. If Ms. Luhr were truly being selfish and self-interested, she would obtain greater satisfaction from greater consumption, but her statement is defying this tenet of rationality which is so important to economic reasoning. She doesn’t want more. She must be irrational.\n\n   \n\n",

  "text": "Hans Feurer is a mainstay of fashion photography since the late 1960s. The peak of his career was in the early 80-s, after the legendary Kenzo Takedo’s advertising campaign. Feurer’s campaign for Kenzo was one of the most popular and it defined him as a successful photographer.\nHans Feurer was born in Switzerland in 1939. After studying art in Switzerland, he worked as a graphic designer, illustrator and artistic director in London. Traces of his previous career are evident throughout his work in his careful compositions and precise styling.\nIn 1966, Hans Feurer travelled to Africa, during which trip he decided to become a photographer. He returned to London and began to compile a portfolio.\n1967 Feurer’s career went up like a rocket. At the same time he worked for the Pirelli calendar in 1974 he also featured shots that appeared in Elle, Vogue, Numero, etc.   \nMore than 30 years ago, in the remote deserts of North America, Hans Feurer was given free to photograph Kenzo Takedo’s 1983 advertising campaign. The career of a Somali-American fashion model Iman also began after this pioneering shooting.\nThese images became the subject of Feurer’s eponymos book, lavishly illustrated with 175 photographs, illustrating his five-decade long career. The book includes Feurer’s photographs for the 1974 Pirelli calendar, for Kodak and for fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia, Elle France and Nova.\n",

  "text": "Dickens and the Bronte sisters wrote in very different ways. Dickens’s style is full of sentimental realism: he describes reality with a sentimental tone and he mixes comedy and pathos. Conversely, the Bronte sisters are influenced by the preceding Romantic  works, and their novels contain Gothic elements such as ghosts and the dark ominous atmosphere.\n \nIf  their themes are considered, it is immediately clear that Dickens builds an extraordinary image of the Victorian society, with a wide range of characters and stories  which reveal the conditions of children and the poor; instead the Brontes’ novels contain the Byronic hero, a male figure with a dark past who wants to find some revenge, as Heatcliff in \"Wuthering Heights\"  or forgiveness as Mr Rochester in \"Jane Eyre\". In contrast with Dickens, the Bronte sisters deal with love and psychologically complex women as protagonists.\n",

  "text": "PROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS FOR OUR ENGLISH COURSE\n\nThe aim of this report is to inform the committee about the wishes of the students who took part in the survey that was conducted lst week in our school.\n\nNEW FACILITIES\n\nGenerally speaking, our school is well equipped. However, there are some defficiencies that could be fixed. Firstly, there is a great demand among our students of a computer room with broadband Internet connection. It is well known that this kind of facility help students make the most of their time while learning English. Secondly, we are in need of a conference room. This will be useful to practise both speaking and listening skills. Finally, it is also recommended to update the books in the library: most of them are quite old and outdated.\n\nACCOMMODATION\n\nOne surprising outcome from the survey was that students do not feel comfortable enough in the residential building. Not only the bedrooms are rather small, but also are they quite cold, because of the lack of a heating system. This is a great problem during the winter: almost every student has suffered from illnesses during that time of the year. There are also numerous complaints in regards to the quality of the food offered in the canteen. It will be advisable to change the catering service.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe will be grateful if any of these problems were solved by the committee. In case you need further information regarding any of these issues, please contact us and I will be glad to respond you as soon as possible.\n",

Maybe if you could just reduce the time you spend with each of your activities, it could work out and you wouldn't need to drop any of them. Organization is the key. However if you are still very stressed, then you might drop one of them, I certainly don't know which one you should drop, I think I would drop the music lessons, because sports are good for your physical and mental health, and also help you to be fit and it's more interesting for me; but maybe a list with the pros and cons of sports and music lessons can help you. \nStart asking yourself Which one do you like the most? Which one do you enjoy more? \nYou should totally do the list and then when you finish it, you can send it back to me, and we can discuss it. You know I'm always here to support you and your decisions.\n\nBut tell me, what else has been going on with you? How's school going? You didn't mention anything about your best mate this time, and you two guys always have a lot of stories to tell.

Variety of cafes and clubs would appeal to a great number of foreigners owing to the fast service and the proper attitude to clients. They would also enjoy our museums and galleries which can bring them closer to our history and traditions.\n\nNew teaching approaches\n\nMore students would be attracted when the school government made some changes in the learning system. I recommend that a more common teaching method should be one-to-one lessons, namely teacher with only one student, as that will contribute to increasing the range of their knowledge and will be also beneficial for students who need more help in a particular subject.\n\nArray of facilities\n\nDissatisfaction with the school equipment is occasionally expressed by the students. Therefore, it is needed to provide new facilities in the classrooms. Computer-based learning would be a great idea of attracting more foreign students because that will maximize their technological capabilities, so that more work will be implemented.\n\nImprovemnts on socialising opportunities\n\nThe school government should offer more extra-curricular activities, including organising excursions in the local area and giving students a chance to choose the school course which appeals to them the most.\n\nRecommendations\n\nI would recommend implementing all the suggestions listed above because these improvements will increase the number of foreign students making their accommodation in the town more pleasant.",

I had the same problems, but I've managed to find some ways to overcome them.\n\nFirst of all, adopting a positive attitude is essential.  You should never be afraid of making a mistake or worry that people will laugh at you.  only then can you really start to speak.  Most people listen for the meaning of what you are trying to say, and do not notice your mistakes.\n\nSecondly, you should try to get as much speaking practice as possible.  In class, answer as many questions as possible, and try to participate in class discussions.  When you are on holiday, try to make contact with other English-speakers, and who knows?  You might make some good friends in this way.\n\nMy problem has always been vocabulary.  i find watching TV programmes in English and reading increase my exposure to new words, and help me recycle words I know in new contexts.\n\nI hope that you will find my suggestions useful.  Don't waste any more time! Get speaking English now!",

  "text": "This is a very common argument: the true genius stands out so much that can not be misunderstood, so if he is not recognized then he is not a genius. But this is faulty reasoning: it accept the idea that a genius is always recognized on the basis that in history geniuses have always been recognized - which is not true, or at least is not demonstrable. They take for granted that historically geniuses have always been recognized, but in reality they are only talking about geniuses that, in fact, have been recognized. They know nothing of those who have not been recognized and that may have been completely erased from history, and therefore cannot be used as an opposite example. To sum up, because the geniuses that we have decided to recognize as such have been recognized, they argue that all the geniuses are always recognized: pure self-referential nonsense.\nIn the 19th century for some, such as Cesare Lombroso, geniality resembles mental illness. For Lombroso exceptional people are independent, away from the banality of life, isolated, impatient, asocial, often considered crazy.",

  "text": "The time in the university is the most important time in our lives because, we learn lot of things and it prepares us for our future career. Some may think that it is better to have classes with discussion of professor and student .Others may disagree. They prefer classes with lecture and almost no discussion. In my opinion classes with discussion are better.\nFirst, classes with discussion between professor and student had an advantage for the student because they learn how to interact with their fellow student. Doubtlessly, such interactions with other people will help you to broaden your mind and learn new things. This will enrich your personality. For instance, a year back I was in north Texas university in USA, there was a health management and policy class with almost no lecture but with lot of time for open discussions. In the beginning, I thought this was disadvantage but this was not true. On one day we spoke about medical treatment cost in different country and one of my friend, Wole was from Nigeria. Consequently, he was able to tell us how the cost of the treatment are less, how doctors are dedicated, and how everybody has access to primary health care. As a result we all know what to be done so that we can make little changes in the reform to lessen the cost of the treatment. As you can see, open discussion in the class are really important since they broaden your horizon and help you to understand different nation’s policies.\nSecond, open discussion in the class help you to develop certain skills in order to become an independent thinker and speaker. It is evident that independent speaking and thinking skills are valuable for your career. For instance, I was really afraid of speaking in front of many people. However, this health management and policy class with open discussion was helpful for me insofar as I learned how to speak in front of others. In order to get good grades we are forced to participate in   discussion. As a result I overcome my anxiety and started speaking in front of those students and I found its not difficult as I expected. This experience taught me that it is better ti participate in a class with open discussion because it provide you with speaking and thinking abilities which are imperative for your career.\nAll in all though some may oppose my opinion, it is clear that classes with open discussion and almost no lecture are preferable because interaction with other student will broaden your mind and you become  a better speaker and thinker.  That is why every university should offer such classes.\n",

  "text": "We human beings are highly socialized creature in the world. Therefore, it is inevitable that we have to learn to be part of the society. Parents, in some cases, are mentors to children. However, considering the complexity of the society, I believe it better to learn in schools rather than from parents.\n\nFirst of all, there is no denying that parents may teach their children enormous fundamental living skills, on which their progeny count. Nevertheless, the skills are not diverse enough for children to deal with specific problems when living in a complex society. For example, one of my senior high school's classmate had encountered communication problem involved in the other's family. As a consequence, they never talk to each other since then.\n\nFollowing the previous paragraph, there will always be people of different living styles, attitudes, and beliefs in every aspect of one's life. Have we not lived and learned the skills in a group, especially in school, we will not be skilled before entering the society. \n\nThe society as a whole is a place where both competition and cooperation take turn continuously influence every member. If we only live in our original family, parents will probably forgive us when we make mistakes. In contrast, living in a society is another story: people might blame, compete, or even hurt others no matter who you are. Learning in schools, however, provides valuable opportunity for children to learn not only from teachers, but also from relationships between peers, and as a result, proves the way for being independent in the future. \n\nIn a nutshell, there is a great deal of knowledge needs to be gained for children in order to live in a society. School, a place with diverse students along with their attitudes towards lives, might be better than learning merely with the parents.",

Furthermore, it gives you the chance to enjoy the works done in that language. That's an incredible opportunity.\n\nNevertheless, when you are learning a language, it brings confussion. You need to change the way you organize your thoughts in order to master it. On the one hand the old one could be hard wired into your brain. On the other hand, the new language needs an additional effort. It also has another negative effect, you have limited time on this planet. There are an incredible amount of things to learn. Why would you waste your time learning a new language, when you probably do not know enough about your own. \n\nIn summary, learning a language is something beautiful, useful and entertaining. It can be hard and it has its downsides. But, as a learner of my third language, I am a firm believer it is the right choice.",

  "text": "Is change always good?\n\n\n Change is always good. But sometimes the pace of change, the direction of change or the consequences of change can make it no good at all.\n   Life implies change. No change, no life. Nature is life and death, construction and destruction. No change, no Nature. To stop the change is impossible That would be against Nature and against ourselves. Every human action provokes a reaction. Every single word causes a gesture, a thought, a change in the others. Every step marks a footprint in the ground. The smallest work changes the environment. Any decision changes future.\n   Life is change. But this change has a rhythm and it is better to respect it. \nLife and change have also a direction, an aim: growth. Everything that doesn’t grow is dead, and death is the opposite of life.\n   To inhibit the growth of a living being is a cruelty, but sometimes it happens. Think of those Chinese women obliged to constrain their feet. Think of  the Olympic Champion Nadia Comaneci ,artificially stopped in her physical development   to preserve her graceful childish body.\n   Equally cruel, it is, in my opinion, to accelerate the pace of growth by forcing .children to work like adults or by inducing little girls to dress and behave as femmes fatales in video-clips or magazine covers.\n   Nature is also change, but in a cycling direction, and in a natural rhythm : the movement of celestial bodies, the rotation of Earth, the alternation of days and nights, the sequence of seasons…, in short, the wheel of life.\n  We lived in a time of accelerated changes. Technology allows us to do and learn in one life’s time more things than our ancestors were able to in several generations. But at the same time we are working against Nature – let’s think of pollution and climate change – and against our own human nature: distress, allergies, strokes and heart attacks are nowadays more and more frequent.\n  I think we should readjust the rhythm of change in order to be able to reinterpret, in a positive sense, Lampedusa words “everything must change so that everything can stay the same”.\n",

Inocencio, surprised by this discovery, asked to his partners in the Order of Saint Bartolo about the taste of their blood, incredibly, after a needlestick in their fingers, all the priests from the congregation agreed that their blood did not taste like the wine converted in Holy blood at the church.\nAt that time, the Order sent to Vatican an urgent message and called the press for making the announcement of the discovery. At this press conference Inocencio assured that next year he will try to prove if pigeons truly represent the Holy Spirit. ",

What can I say? \n Usually my eating habits are similar to the most Portuguese; I have my breakfast around 7.30 and 8.00, I eat bread with cheese or jam and I drink a large glass of milk with cereals. At lunch many people eat a lot! I start with a small soup and then I have the main dish and the desert. If I have some time before 14.00, I love to have a coffee with friends – in Portugal everyone drinks an espresso! In the afternoon I eat some cookies. Finally, I have dinner with my family - always at 20.00! We eat a light meal and fruit. \n What is my favourite Portuguese meal? It's pork which is seasoned with red wine and, then, is well braised. But the most famous dish uses cod.\n\n Good luck! Best wishes!\n Andreia",

  "text": "What is cultural literacy?\nI was researching some definitions of cultural literacy. It seems to me that the following definitions show an overall context of what is cultural literacy. \nCultural literacy is the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture. Cultural literacy is Knowing about and respecting the cultures of others. In order to be culturally literate, you need to be familiar with all manner of things, from Waterloo, Hamlet and “Call me Ishmael,” to the Wife of Bath, the Magna Carta, Tutankhamen, the Pythagorean Theorem and 1066. To be familiar with something is far different from being an expert in it, and it’s entirely manageable.\nA literate reader knows the object-language's alphabet, grammar, and a sufficient set of vocabulary; a culturally literate person knows a given culture's signs and symbols, including its language, particular dialectic, stories, entertainment, idioms, idiosyncrasies, and so on. \nThe culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency, while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally-conditioned allusions, references to past events, idiomatic expressions, jokes, names, places, etc.\nAccording to UNESCO literacy is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender equality and achieve sustainable development, peace and democracy.\nMy personal opinion cultural literacy is the way to understand, learn and know about other cultures. Also you can be understood by other cultures.\n",

  "text": "I think it is fair to say basketball is one of the most popular sports on the planet, both in number of viewers and players. There is probably an array of motives to explain such phenomenon but for me that happens for one particular reason; the shot clock. The shot clock is a timer that dictates the amount of time during which one team can maintain possession of the ball. The idea behind it is to quicken the pace of the game and preventing it from becoming stalled. A corious fact is that out of the five most popular sports in the world only basketball keeps track of possession time and to me that's exactly what sets him apart from the others.\n\nWhile watching or playing any kind of sport, there's nothing worse than a team or a player trying to waste time untill the clock runs out, the game becomes dull and boring and you can't enjoy the excitment that only the uptempo style of play can provide. The bottom line is; a fast paced game is a much more exciting experince for players and viewers as opposed to a slow paced one and that makes the \"shot clock\" fundamental to the dynamics of the game.\n\nAnd for anyone trying to become a good basketball players the two most important things to understand (as it is for most sports in general) are the values of practice and awareness. Practice is the one thing that can increase the probability of desireable results and awareness is what gives you the ability to adapt to different situations, and the combination of the two is the only way to success, so if you want to be a good player you need to put your energy and focus on practice and stay alert and surveing the court at all times so you can be aware of what is happening around you.",

Although several causes for this problem can be found in the modernisation of our society, this modern society can also provide solutions for the amelioration of the level of fitness of young people.\nOne of the reasons for the worsening of the health of young people is the increasing use of cars. Nowadays, parents take their children everywhere by car, whereas they would have to go everywhere by bike or by foot twenty years ago. This is a result of the decreasing price of cars due to innovation in the car industry, which enabled more and more people to buy a car (and use it).\nHowever, possibilities to make the youth healthier are also provided by our modern civilisation. For example, commercials can be used to stimulate youngsters to take up exercise by showing the positive effects.\nIn conclusion, I feel that not only the ground for the low level of fitness of today's youth, but also the clue to get youngsters fitter, lies in the modernity.

  "text": "Good thriller movies have become increasingly rare in the last few years, and to find some among big productions casting famous actors is even harder, if not impossible. Most of these, in fact, have very predictable plots, are full of cliches and since it's so easy to figure out how they will end, they are usually very boring. This is why I was very surprised when I came out of the theater after seeing \"Looper\" and thought \"Hey, I just saw a thriller with Bruce Willis in it, and it was actually a really good one!\" \nThe story is set in the future, about thirty years from now, when time travel had been invented but was used only by criminal organizations who sent those they want killed in the past where a professional killer, a looper, was waiting for them and for the silver strapped to their body. The main character is Joe, a looper who has to face an older version of himself sent back in time to be killed. By letting his older self go Joe changes his past, and therefore his future, leading to a series of unexpected events, and to an even more unexpected ending!\nMy expectations were not very high, but I have to say the movie was surprisingly good, in fact it was not boring at all, and had a few big twists which took me completely by surprise. \nTime travelling is only a means to the development of the story, and the future society is quite similar to the present one, so even if you are not big science fiction fans, I suggest you give this movie a chance, I am sure you won't be disappointed.

  "text": "In the competitive world that we inhabit, dominating a technique and having a deep knowledge of a given field is essential for both academic and professional success. We've reached a point where this training starts at an early age in the form of extracurricular activities, such as music classes, learning languages and playing sports. The inherent tendency to provide the best to our offspring catalyze parents to invest in their kids as to prepare them for an unpredictable future. The haste that results from this process doesn't allow parents to think over some potentially harmful myths that they take for reality, regardless that it may compromise their kid's motivation and self-confidence, all because of their  \"is talent innate or can it be acquired?\".\n\nContemporarily, the most wide-spread belief is that some people are born with a talent and some unlucky ones simply aren't. This assertion may boost the confidence of parents whose children show a remarkable ability in the early infancy, as though this capability could be the celestial sign that their toddler is gifted or going to grow as child prodigy. The adepts of this idea usually mention extraordinary people in order to reinforce their own believe in their child's potential to become a known genius. One of the most common examples is Beethoven, known for composing high-quality piano pieces as a young child. Little known is what was the role played by music in his life and how was his relationship with it previous to his first deed. Admittedly, I don't know it myself.\n\nAny one who challenges the aforementioned common-sense isn't immediately drawn to embrace and believe the less common, but still popular and not scientific, concurrent idea. Many do believe that a talent can be taught, although not so easily. The \"10 000-hours rule\" is said to have a scientific base, in spite of the fact that most of its defendants have never read the study that stablished it. According to this rule, any person can develop a talent after 10 000 hours of training. This amount of time doesn't fit normal workers and students' tight schedules and busy daily lives, therefore being labeled as unpractical and unachievable. The normal response to this conclusion is, as I and many people who gave up learning a language simply because fluency is out of reach if you don't have this time available, is the loss of motivation.\n\nThe main problem of having these two perspectives on talent is that both of them are basically negative. Either of them put a heavy burden on parents and on their children. One asserts that talent is a matter of luck; the second, of pure time demanding and presumably expensive dedication. Clearly, both rely on the common beliefs to be sustained. As any other unscientific \"truth\" that circulates and cause harm to our society, this one can only be eliminated through the reading of scientific and specialised  publications on the topic, so that the effective manners of becoming talented in something can be adopted, before the popular believes take our motivation and self-belief away.\n",

In the morning we're not used to eating salty food like salami, eggs or cheese.\nWorking people usually have lunch at about 13.00 and they have something simple such a pasta or a sandwich and a coffee because the break is short and they have to go back to work and need to be concentrate and don’t get asleep!\nDuring the day Italian people drink a lot of coffee and everyone has a coffee maker at home!\nYoung people do not drink coffee: they prefer to drink Coke while eating junk food, which is cheaper and tastier than pastasciutta.\nThe time for dinner is not the same in all parts. In northern Italy people eat at about 19, whereas in southern Italy they eat at about 21. I get home late and I have no time to cook elaborate meals so I usually cook a  steak with vegetables. Sometimes I give myself a slice of homemade cake. Italian eat also a lot of fruits like apples, oranges and other fruit of the season.\nOn Saturdays or Sundays we don't have to work, so we have time to cook and we prepare typical Italian food with two or more courses.\nI really like the lasagna, made with a flat and long pasta with bechamel, tomatoes and meat and I love the pasta Amatriciana made with spaghetti, fresh tomatoes, bacon and a typical Roman cheese called pecorino. Another typical dish from the northern Italy (it comes from the mountains) is pizzoccheri which is a wheat pasta topped with cabbages, butter and typical cheese.\nEvery region has a typical food and a typical cheese. I once read that in Italy we produce 450 different cheeses and I don't think a foreigner would try them all!\nI’m talking about Gorgonzola cheese, which tastes really strong and isn't very nice because it has a blue mould inside. \nI remember having tasted the \"casu marzu\", a typical Sardinian cheese which has some little worm inside!\nHowever, eating is for us a tradition that puts the families together and recipes are handed down from generation to generation.\nI hope I've helped you!\nBest wishes,\n\nRoberta Trentino\n",

That's because there're many scientific facts have been revealed. Furthermore, information about these facts have become much more available. Also, people today tend to get higher degrees than people in the past.\nThe great expansion of knowledge makes people more educated than before. Today, people know more about phenomena that were considered obscure in the past. For example, people today know more about space, genetics, and diseases. That makes them more educated.\nFurthermore, it's easy to know about these valuable discoveries. There're many more libraries and learning courses available than before. In addition, information about anything can be found easily on the Internet.\nIn the past, graduating from high school was considered an achievement; today it's not. To be considered well educated, people should graduate from a college. Also, there're more people who continue their education after graduation from college. \nIn conclusion, the average level of education in the past isn't enough today to be considered educated. ",

Hereby we want to create consciousness in the pupils`minds about their new knowledge. The end of the evaluation is that every pupil writes a post-it note that answers the following questions: What have I learned from this course? What did I like most about this course? How could the course be improved? Hereby we both want the pupils to reflect their learning and bring the teacher valuable information for the next time.\nIn this class there are strong wishes about certain areas regarding America that the pupils want to learn: 10 pupils would like to learn about American High School Life, 4 pupils would like to learn about National Parks in America, 4 pupils would like to learn about Native Americans and 1 pupil would like to learn about American Motor Industry. \nTaking the importance of learner autonomy and the importance of the pupils`motivation into consideration we have decided that they can follow their interests in this course.

  "text": " Why people become homeless? One of the reasons is they are poor because they cannot get a job. I believe we can decline the number of homeless people in Japan by providing them with information and skills.\n\n Those who become homeless usually do not know that there is a system to help poor people. For example, if they do not have enough money that is needed to have home and to buy things necessary to live, they can get a financial support by government. However, those who do not know about it cannot get such support. Homeless people tend to unable　to collect information because of lack in means to do it.  We need to let them get information. \n \n Skills are also needed to get a job. The skills include the ability to communicate with people and to conquer hardships. I have seen a TV program about homeless people. In the program, one homeless man quit his job because he could not have a good relationship in the office. He tried several jobs but he could communicate well in none of them. He was tired of himself, lost interest in working and became homeless. Then, he came to know that there was a class that provide homeless people with skills of cleaning floor for free. He decided to join the class. Sometimes the lesson was hard, but the staff there praised him when he did well. Little by little, he grew interest in working. He came to know how pleasant it is to overcome hard situations. He also learned to how to build a good relationship with people through talking his fellows. He finally wanted to find a job again. If more lessons like this are provided and more homeless people get the skills, the problem of homelessness will become less serious.\n\n To conclude, giving information about support that they can receive from the government, and skills is very helpful way to solve homelessness in Japan.

  "text": "At the moment, all governments around the world argue about climate change. Some of them think global warming is the most significant problem, despite others believe deforestation has a higher impact on our world. Now I will discuss both sides.\n\nOn the one hand, global warming is a result of many emitted toxic gases. These are, for example, carbon dioxide and methane. As we all know, trees store carbon dioxide. So, we can say, with less deforestation there would be less global warming. But what are the results of global warming? The primary outcome is the increasing temperature, and this leads to melting glaciers. These glaciers are habitat for polar bears and many other arctic animals. The melting glacier will bring a higher sea level. That means coastal cities will be flooded. This flooding leads to starvation because of fewer harvest yields and this creates many refugees.\n\nOn the other hand deforestation is, as said, another part of global warming due to less carbon dioxide storing trees. But incinerate a huge part of the rainforest means a destruction of the habitat of wildlife. Global warming is a primary cause of starvation but also does deforestation. Because the roots do not hold the fertile soil, and now, it will be blown away by the wind. \n\nTo sum up both issues have enormous impacts on our world. In both animals and people are affected. But in my opinion, you can stop global warming by stopping deforestation first. Then you can focus on global warming.\n",

However, experience is extremely important, I disagree that the academics are not important.\n\nFirst of all, formal education is essential for employees, it is considered as a fundamental basis of any practical job. Success in a job depends on the amount of theoretical knowledge that a person had in academic institution. In addition, every phenomenon is based on theory. When employees face any problems or difficulties in work, it must be referred to the theory that explain this phenomenon, without knowing this theory employees can’t overcome these difficulties, for instance, engineering science seems practical, but each part of engineering science is based on theories. Thereby, engineers must take demanding knowledge to be successful in a career. \n\nSecond of all, theoretical qualifications are crucial for employees, as it helps t people to think and solve all problems in a fair way. Scientific approach is more important to deal with problems, beginning with determining problems and then studying all factors and related information. Then employees are able to suggest the best solution, this approach is  developed in formal education. Moreover, studying in a university provides an opportunity to interact with a wide range of people and thus build unique communication skills that are very important for employees. Finally, knowledge could make an open-mined person who has ability to deal with problems in fairway. \n\n\nTo conclude, theoretical knowledge is more important than practical skills. It is the main part that helps employees to be successful in careers. It is certainly true that markets cannot abandon the formal qualification in future.\n",

  "text": "Some people are convinced that public transport has no future because the car is so much more convenient.  There  is more than one way to look at this statement. The use of  public transport has a lot of advantages, but on the other hand, some disadvantages can be distinguished. It depends on where and what kind of place you want to reach and it depends on the time of the  day\n In this article both sides are discussed. First what are the advantages of using the bus, or train? When traveling to city centers, choosing public transport is to be advised, because parking a car in the city is really expensive and it is very hard to find a space.  When in the center and wanting to enjoy various sights, by car it is hard to get from on place to the other, because the circulation is dense. IN that way it will take a lot of your time, while the bus or tramway have their own bus lanes, and hence are running smoothly. In that case the choice for public transport will be preferable. \nWhen  traveling to rural areas, it  is quite difficult by public transport, because sometimes there is hardly any no train or bus  for the far out places and the tiny villages. Another problem might be the timetable. Because not may people going to these places, the schedule will be very tight and the bus will only leave once every hour. If there  is a bus or train available, it will stop at almost every village. Most of these buses will make many stops which makes it even more time consuming. \n\nIn the end of the day you should choose public transport or car according to the purpose of your trip. And sometimes public transport is better and sometimes using the car is better.",

  "text": "The Jirga is a ‘traditional system’ of justice, which is actively practiced in, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Baluchistan as well as in districts of Sindh bordering with Baluchistan as to resolve legal cases and disputes. The system, which was in practice since the British rule, was modified under the ‘Special Provision Ordinance (Criminal Provisions 11) of 1968’ . Besides dispensing justice and dealing with judicial cases, the Jirga also covers all important aspects of monetary, political, and communal life of tribal society. \n However, in its present form, the tribal Jirga especially in Sindh province has generated heated debate about its legal position as well as conflict of its rules and codes with the constitution of Pakistan, law of the land or formal justice system as well as international human rights standards and conventions. Strongest allegation on the Jirga system or ‘informal justice system’ has been its unfairness against innocents during the course of decisions and execution on variety of its rules and regulations.\nThis informal system of justice is being practiced in rural areas of Sindh and Baluchistan. In fact informal justice system is directly proportional to the Jirga that originally owns its roots to Baloch culture and had been transferred to Sindhi society progressively.\n“Historically, the Jirga System dates back to the days of Naseer Khan of Kalat, Baluchistan. He was the Khan of Kalat from 1741 to 1795. Naseer Khan was an able General, trained at the court of Ahmad Shah Abdali, the hero of the third battle of famous Pani Pat.”   \n\n\n",

  "text": "In recent years, many nations are developing their own economy rapidly, and it takes that many areas of farmlands and forests are being cut down to build a better and bigger house and a more convenient transportation system. However , many countries have become more aware of the environmental issues each nation faces. In my opinion, we need a more convenient life but also to maintain a certain balance.\n\nFrist of all, the biggest problem is that the world's resources are extremely unequal. For example, Japan is the world's third largest economy after the United States and China, its economy is so developed, but food, oil, and other resources are all imported, and it put a lot of heavy industry into developing countries in order to protect its own environment. This has led to a growing gap between the rich and the poor, while the environment is also getting worse and worse. \n\nSecendly, with the increasing of the earth's population, the area of farmland is also decreasing. People in economically developed areas are in the pursuit of the perfect life and the people in the undeveloped areas are strving. So I think that the government must do something in this respect. \n\nThe government should find a balance point between economic development and agricultural development . I think that it would have to develop science and technology such as Yuan Longping's hybrid rice, or after the food can make people's great and then vigorously develop the economy. As part of the same planet, protecting the global environment is not only the task of the government but also the task of each of us.",

In addition, I have privately coached  5th and 6th grade pupils in Mathematics, English, German and French for the last 3 years.

My babysitting duties were to bring the children to bed, provide lunch or dinner, play with and read to them. With regard to the tutorials. I have put together my own exercise material, looked and discussed class tests and helped the pupils with their homework.\n\nSince I worked twice as a group instructor at a local summer camp, I think that I am well-equipped to deal with 8-12 year old children from the experience I mentioned.\n\nI hope you will invite me for a job interview, via Skype or in in person and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nTessa Foerster",

That is why my parents decided to go on a bike trip to the forest outside our city. I had never been there before, so I thought - why not?\nWe set off at 6 pm and reached our destination an hour later. Suddenly, it got so dark, that I could not see a thing. I started shouting as my parents were out of sight, but nobody answered. After a while I started shaking - I was alone in a forest! I tried to call my mother, but while I was typing her number on the keypad, the battery ran out of power... So there was nothing better to do but stay in the same place and wait for someone to help me. Luckily, it was quite warm, so there was one thing less to worry about.\nI did not have to wait so long, though - after a while I saw our car's lights glowing in the darkness. I felt relieved. Next time I will be going on such a trip I need to make sure that I have a fully charged mobile with me.\n",

Attached to this letter of application, you will find my curriculum vitae. \nI recently completed the four-year bachelor degree European Studies at Zuyd University in Maastricht. I learned about corporate communication, about management, organization and communication and some basics of marketing, etc. Also, I have studied French and Spanish and have participated in many group projects. During the studies, I went abroad to the University of Paris where I studied political sciences and international management. After my studies I did a master in cultural sciences at the University of Maastricht. As a result of this training, I have excellent communication and analytical skills. I had worked in a clothing shop in the past, so I have some sales experience as well.\nI have done an internship at a reception in one of the best VIP design hotels in Sevilla, Spain. My duties included check guests in and out, plan and organize group arrivals, assist in cash advances, exchange money, check guest folios and give commercial information to customers. In this way I have to some extent developed strategic thinking on individual client needs. I know what clients want and know how to deal with that. During my studies, I had to make several times portfolios and had negotiation classes, so that will be no problem for me.\nI am very interested in this post, since it offers an excellent opportunity to develop my career in international management.\nIf you have any further questions, I can be contacted on 00316 12 34 56 78.

She has a really skinny body, and her hand are long and covered in brown spots. Nana talks in such a peaceful way. Tone of her voice is so gentle and so calm. It calmes me down and freaks me out at the same time.\n\n\n\nParents told me that grandma is a very sick person. When I go to sleep she is constantly sitting beside me. And also she is watching me with eyes wide opened. Lately I couldn't get enough sleep because of that. Nana gives me feeling like I will get killed in my sleep. It feels just like a horror move . Reality is killing me. I love her but she scares the hell out of me. While sleeping I can feel her rubbing my feet  and touching  my head. It is creepy feeling. She doesn't want to leave me. I don't know why. Maybe she is afraid of dying alone. I know she is ill. But I never thought that it can be that serious.\n\n\n\nI love my grandma. She might be crazy, but I love her.

Moreover, they travel all around the world and spend their holidays in expensive resorts, get the best hotel rooms and the most efficient service. \nOn the other hand, lack of privacy is a major disadvantage in a famous person's life as their personal life's boundaries are constantly trespassed by paparazzi and journalists. Besides, the more they succeed, the more their fans expect of them to achieve. Owing to this state of constant stress, many of them are bound to have alcoholism problems, drug-addiction and depression.\n In conclusion, fame may be nice but it´s not an easy path to walk on.

But then, every once and a while, one can also hear stories of brothers fighting over the inheritance, or a parent not speaking to their child for making a wrong life decision. In the majority of cases, members of a family have the same blood and genes and they also share living space. This results in common opinions,support when there's a problem and mutual understanding without many words. On the other hand, we tend to have higher expectations and less patience when it comes to our loved ones. The members of your family in deed are your best friends, but only if you don't take them for granted, if you respect them and their space and opinion. One should also bear in mind that sometimes it's necessary to compromise, especially when it comes to material or financial issues. Once you accept that your sibling, although similar, isn't the same as you, or that your child has a different view on their future, it's easier to embrace the differences and be a supportive family member. And at the end of the day, nothing can beat homemade comfort food and a laugh with your family.",

Those are my findings and my recommendations.\n\n1- Facts and Findings.\n\n- The unrivaled place for young people is the municipal center for youth. This innovative center has a lot of first-class facilities for young people. It has a professional rehearsal studio that local music groups can just rent for pocket money, they can also rent instruments by paying a small refundable deposit. A small cinema, a library, games rooms, a TV-room with an enormous flat screen TV where teenagers usually watch football matches, a basic gym, and a little arena.\n\n- The second best place is a private disco for youngsters. It was renewed last year and regulars like it a lot. The main problem is the high price of the tickets. Kids have to pay 10 euros just for the entrance getting anything else.\n\n- There is another place where local youth spend a lot of hours the new and magnificent mall. It has 150 stores and about 40 fast food shops. They especially like the music store and a magnificent t-shirt store owned by two local designers, there you can design your own item and collect it the following week.\n\nThese are the main places where young people usually go.",

An individual must be aware of the result of his act on the environment, be it due to personal or professional act, in order to maintain it in healthy state. In Clayton, my hometown, people are fond of maintaining the environment and they actively participate in encouraging the ones who try to work towards its progress as well as in protesting against the ones who tend to cause harm to it. \n\nThe municipal board of Clayton conducts meetings fortnightly to communicate about the improvements that have been made and that have been planned to be implemented in future in the town. Representatives elected by respective communities attend the meeting. It is then their responsibility to communicate the message to all members of their community. These meetings are organized according to their planned schedule and the results were surprising. Earlier, regardless of whether the rubbish was recyclable or not, it was disposed off in the same bin. Later, people were educated regarding recyclable, non-recyclable and organic waste and were also informed that the rubbish was to be disposed-off in respective bins. This rubbish was collected by the municipal board on a daily basis and proper disposal methods were employed. \n\nDevelopment was also happening at the same time which was good for our town, but, lots of trees were also cut down as a result. People started protesting against them to avoid any further damage to the environment. Hence, the municipal board decided to invite the developers as well in the meeting that was scheduled in a weeks time. In the following meeting, it was decided that on the following Sunday everyone will be planting a tree that will be provided by the municipal board for free. On the following Sunday, as discussed, trees were planted and before we realized, they started adding beauty to our town. \n\nTaking care of environment is everyone's duty and it must be performed responsibly. The municipal board of Clayton does an excellent job in educating its people to keep the environment in a healthy state. I hope people must take them as an example and introduce similar ideas in their own towns or villages. After all, it is the place we all live in.\n",

  "text": "Computer’s have become an essential part of our lives in the last few decades. They have replaced many things like books. It is true that because of computers, we do many things fast and easily. However, they stopped us from  doing many fun things as well, what are those things, do we really need computers, are they really helping us?\n\tWe use computers to help us with so many different types of things. To begin with, they help us solve really complex mathematical equations. They were invented to help us calculate things in the first place anyway. Computers are an essential part of  NASA, since they try to calculate really complex equations to help them solve the mysteries of space. But us, ordinary people, don’t use computers to solve equations, we use them to type things, print things, design things, make games and to do much more... We made programs that make computers do very interesting things, like graphics. And we use graphics to make all kinds of things, like games or 3D house models that help engineers. Furthermore, the major thing that computers made easier for us is, communication. Humans are social animals, we communicate because communication is in our genes, if we don’t communicate we go insane. So computers help us do that, they help us share our thoughts and feelings with other people easily. Finally, while doing this they actually save us from using a lot of paper. So computers help us with so many things and also save trees.\n\tIn the other hand, computers have very bad effects on both to us, and the environment. For example, research has shown that not computers themselves, but the things we use or play on them are addictive, like social networks or games. Also looking at a screen is tiring for your eyes and if your eyes get too tired they can get damaged forever. Despite the fact that computers decreased the use of paper, they’re still harmful to the environment since they consume tonnes of electricity.\n\tComputers made our lives easier without doubt, so it is normal that they have some bad effects. There is a saying in Turkish saying ‘If you love a rose, you have to withstand against it’s spikes.’. So it is normal that computers have bad effects on us and the environment. In my opinion computers might be the best invention ever made, since they’ve become an essential part of our daily lives and since we rely on them so much.\n",

Most people think that choosing a grammar school is the best option, because it opens the door to university, while technical institutes are put in a corner. That is actually a mistake, because the schools who best prepare students to working life are technical institutes, who emphasize the real world applications of the studied subjects through laboratories and industry experiences. Conversely, grammar schools extremely focus on theory. In fact, students learn lots of formulas and principles without actually linking them with one another in order to use them in real life. I think that problem should be addressed.\n\nSuggestions\nWhat I would suggest in order to deal with this problem is to integrate more laboratory experiences also in grammar schools, like chemistry experiments or bacteria observation with microscopes. Furthermore, schools should offer a year in industry for students in the last two years, which would not only teach them a lot more than school only would, but it would also attract more people to the school itself.\n\nConclusion\nPeople should get used to the fact that most companies will also care about your previous work experience, and the idea of gaining that through school would be really appealing.",

This is because technology has become a relevant tool for work and study in particular and an important instrument in life in general .\n\nIt is quite evident that learning ancient languages today is not as relevant as it is used to be in the past. \nOn one hand, it allows the students to understand and translate ancient texts and helps them to learn about cultures from the past. \nOn the other hand, this does not bring too many employment opportunities.\n Recent surveys proved that the study of these languages does not add much to the students future success.\n\nRelated to learning computer programming, it guarantees a good living.\nIt is a known fact that there are very few computer programmers. Furthermore as technology changes more and more, there will be a greater demand of these skills in the future.\nIt is evident that technology is in every aspect of our lives. \n\nIn conclusion, there are a lot of subjects that might be taught at school, but there is no doubt that Computer Programming should be included as a highlighted subject in the syllabus of any school  serious programme.\n\n\n",

  "text": "Groban: All that echoes\n  'All that echoes', by Josh Groban, is the sixth studio album of this American singer and songwriter. It contains twelve tracks to enjoy that you wait impatiently for the next song. That fascinating album surprises not only the variety of subjects but also the strength of instrumental sounds.\n  The first single, 'Brave', is a chart-topping song about emotions such as fear and fight. The arrangements are simple and effective and the powerful voice plays harmoniously with the rich sound. It is bound to be at the top of my list. False alarm, which is the second track, is totally different and mysterious because of wealth of musical instruments. Groban sings well-known from the film 'Once\" song called 'Falling slowly' in his own fantastic way but listeners get used to the first version might be disappointed. Musically satisfying 'Happy in my heartache' tells the story of tragic love. \n  Once again, Groban fascinates audiences from all over the world with his mature voice and catchy tunes. I definitely recommend that album to your collection. It's a must!",

Besides, he also came to being keen on learning foreign languages so much so that he decided to enroll on courses of French and German. \nHe became HIGHLY skilled at writing in these languages and this ability turned OUT to be useful in his job. One day, he took part in a competition intended for the selection of the head of the post office where he was still working.

After using two times, problems started to appear. \nI noticed that the first malfunction was safety lock which demanded applying of great force. My wife had to ask me for help, because she wasn't strong enough to push the safety lock through. We discovered that another problem when tried to use the blender. I put some ice cream and milk in the blender and pushed the \"start\" button. It started working but suddenly got stuck and we were unable to use it since. I was very surprised to discover that many problems in a quite expensive model.\nNaturally, I returned the blender to you to be replaced with a new one. Your assistant said that I would have to wait only a week. After two weeks the food processor had still not arrived. Finally, four weeks later, I was contacted by your representative. Imagine my feelings when I learned from him that I can't receive the same model of food processor as I bought. As a solution he offered that upgrade my model to a better and this too will take two weeks. \nI am very disappointed with both the equipment and the service have I received. Therefore, I expect refunding my full amount $180 as soon as possible. \n\nYours faithfully,\nSmith",

I am very interested in it because I would like to broaden my experience in activities with children.\nNot only do I have a big nuclear family who is made up by four siblings, but I also have a big extended family. Besides as I am the eldest brother, I am used to dealing with children.\nRegarding my experience, on the one hand, I take part in a soccer club in university, consequently, I have some experience working in a team. On the other hand, I have just finished my first year in Physical Education degree, where we played a lot of different sports. It is true, that water sports are not the most usual there, however, I enjoy practising them every summer on the beach.\nAlthough I am Spanish and English is not my first language, I can speak fluently because my mother is Irish and she always used to speak English to us.\nI feel I would be the person you are looking for because I am patient and alert. These are the most important skills when you deal with children, due to de fact that you ought to keep on the lookout for their behaviour. Moreover, from my point of view, children need to focus their attention in a constant activity, my sense of humour and creativity allow me to change activities quickly in order to maintain their attention. \nIf you offer me the chance to join your team, you shall not be disappointed.\nI would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience. Please contact me regarding any queries you may have.\nYours sincerely,\n",

  "text": "   Those days, travelling by car is becoming more popular among urban people. This kind of transport is regarded as a covenient way. Government build more roads and more families are able to afford cars. As a result, some people hold the opinion that in the future, there will be no public transport. However, I disgree with this idea. Instead, I suppose that public transport will play an essential part in future life. There are three advantages of public transport over private cars that I want to explain.\n   On one hand, it is enviornmentally friendly to use public transport rather than cars. Nowadays, buses using electronic power instead of petrol have appeared in urban cities. They produce no gas to the air, leading to little air pollution. In the meanwhile, if people prefer to take buses or subways, there will be less noises in the street. On the other hand, buses and subways can accommodate more passengers while a car can only contains 4 to 5 people totally. Compared with cars, public transport has larger capability of conveying, which saves space and costs less. Last but not least, fewer car accidents will happen if people choose to use public transport so traffic jams will be avoided especially in rush hours. Thus, it will be more smooth and pleasant for passengers to travel on the road.\n   In conclusion, public transport is a cost-effective way for people to travel, which also contributes to the sustainable development of society.",

  "text": "『Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.』\n\nThe statement claims that the educational institutions are responsible for convincing students not to put too much effort on fields or subjects that they are not good at, which I cannot agree with. This statement fails to consider the main function of education, which is not training superstars or perfect robots but teaching students how to face and solve the problems they are confronted instead of escape. The responsibility of education institutions should be helping and guiding students to make their own decisions, not making decisions for students.\n\nAmong various purposes of education, in my opinions, the most important one is teaching students to solve problems. Confronting the challenging instead of turning aside, trying to think of possible solutions instead of giving up at the beginning, always being positive to unknown instead of negative and retreating, all these are the main reason why the humankinds can keep improving. Transferring these knowledge and experiences to young people is the meaning of education. If the educational institutions always stopped students from trying just because they have less chance to be successful, we’ll never have people such as Thomas Edison or Albert Einstein, who were considered as stupid kids in school but didn’t give up trying. Convincing students to take a more comfortable road by giving up the possible risk is definitely not the proper attitude the educational institution should have.\n\nOne may suggest that everyone need to learn to assess the risk before invest, however, teaching students how to assess not assessing for students is the responsibility of educational institutions. Truly that knowing one’s limit is the first step of bringing out the maximum value of one’s talent. It’s not smart to encourage people doing what exceed their ability. Nevertheless, the ability of identifying limit of oneself can be best learned from experiences. One would never know he/she can swim or not without jumping into the swimming pool. The responsibility of the educational institutions is to make sure that he/she won’t be in danger in the swimming pool instead of dissuading him/her from getting close to the water. Educational institutions should guide students to have better self-understanding and self-assessing, not persuading them to follow the pre-decided road.\n\nLast but not least, what is the definition of “success”? How do the educational institutions judge a student being likely to succeed or not? What if a student would rather to do something he/she likes instead of he/she is good at? Not everyone is living for the kind of success which most people agree with, such as wealthy, fame or power. For some people, living a life which enable them do what they like and like what they are doing is enough to be considered as a successful life. They might not be the top, but they are self-actualized and satisfied, and only in such situation they can provide most to the world, just like Albert Einstein has said, “Try not to become a man of success but rather to become a man of value.”\n\nConsidering all the above, I cannot agree with the statement that persuading students not to pursue field of study in which they have less possibility to be successful is the responsibility of the educational institutions. In my opinions, the purpose of the education is to teach and guide students how to facing the problems and making their own decision properly, not force them to accept what have already been arranged for them. \n",

  "text": "Contribution\n\nThe most popular TV programme in Germany is definitely the news programme „Tagesschau“ which is airing about three times a day on the channel „Das Erste/ARD“. It is a news programme based on well researched facts and offers a wide range of all the important information you need. Every now and then they even air an extra reportage on a certain field like the European election or the crisis in the Ukraine.\n\nThe main reason for its popularity is its accuracy and funded research which makes it more reliable than other news programmes. Moreover they try to be interesting for all ages so they post on facebook and twitter as well which draws the attention of the younger generation to the programme. Nevertheless they always inform about the latest news on their website and in their TV show as soon as possible and in addition they give a great overview of the necessary background information you need.\n\nIn my personal opinion I strongly believe that this TV programme earns its popularity. The way they present themselves in the media and the well funded research are truly unique in German news programmes. Although I am rarely watching the show on TV I like the way they are trying to keep up with modern technology and that they are always making boring nes so vivid interesting through short video clips, pictures and their choice of words. If you ever get to watch TV in Germany you should definitely try out this interesting news programme.",

Do you get along with your superior? \nLast summer I finally managed to change my boring job and that tiny clothes job for a better one. I worked at the local cinema where Fred was also working. It was amazing!\nWe'd get there at about half past eight every day and started cleaning the main room and proceeding with the smaller rooms in the cinema. It was a lot of fun mainly because it was just us two. We'd make jokes and chase each other with the brooms, trying to smack the other on the head. \nThe main advantage of working at the local cinema was the free popcorn and getting to enjoy the newest films. We got to see the new Bond movie and also the blockbuster Spiderman 3 there. My job was cleaning the cinema, but Fred's main responsibility was to roll the movies for the clients, so I'd make sure I finished cleaning earlier, so I could enjoy watching movies with him. \nBut enough about me!

He did like his job but as we all know, sometimes people suddenly feel they have to change something. They don't know exactly what they should do, what to change - buy a new pair of shoes or maybe do something more - move to a different city or even to a foreign country. Michael had exactly the same problem.\nOne day he woke up much earlier than used to. He prepared a coffee for himself and turned the TV on to watch the news. He sat on a sofa in front of a television and suddenly he realised the fact that every morning was exactly the same, nothing has changed since such many years! \"I won't stand it any longer\" - he thought. But what to do?

People have only one life, not more!\"\nAt that moment he was pretty sure what to do now. He took a sheet of paper and a pen and started to write. After 10 minutes a resignation letter was ready to bring it to Michael's boss. He arrived on the company as quickly as the crowded London's streets allowed him.\n\"I need to talk to boss\" - he said to Jane, the main secretary of the company. Without waiting for her answer, he just went into the office, gave to Mike, his boss for 10 years, an envelope with a resignation letter and left. It all took about 3 minutes. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.",

Regret had been filling up his soul since last Friday. He could not keep his betrayal inside any longer so he entered the living room and told her. The words coming up from his mouth like a litany, almost mechanically as he realized that there was no turning back. Tears ran down Rachel's face. No words, not a single comment.

  "text": "  Nowadays students need to learn both language and mathematics until go to university, even some of them still need to study them in the university. A large number of examples prove that some of them are good at language whereas others are skilled in mathematics. This essay will discuss the differences and similarities for learning a language and learning mathematics.\n  The ways of learning a language and mathematics are different. For studying a language, people need to communicate with others to improve their speaking and listening levels and read variety of overseas book to increase their reading and writing skills. Furthermore, people need to have a good memory to remember a large number of words. In general, studying a language focuses more on a large account of individual effort and little talent. However, for learning mathematics, students need to listen carefully in the class and find some rules to solve questions. Instead of rote learning, they should remember different types of formulas by practicing in a mass of examples. To sum up, teachers, skills and talent are more important for learning mathematics. \n   However, there are some similarities for those two subjects. Firstly, both those courses need to do a mass of practices, even the ways are different. People need to spend a huge account of time on doing exercise after class. Secondly, associability is important for both languages and mathematics. For example, when people learn a new word or a formula, they need to think about how to use it in real sentence or exercises. \n  In conclusion, people need to find a right way which can save much time and energy to study these two subjects. It is the most important thing that they should think about carefully before they start their study. \n",

  "text": "Shenzhen—China’s largest migrant city and a neighbor of Hong Kong—is a remarkable place that I call home. Most Shenzhen residents come from different cultural backgrounds and speak various regional dialects. Meanwhile, we embrace a superordinate Shenzhen identity, which is characterized by a culture of openness, tolerance, and creativity. Our differences, it seems, do not make a difference.\n\nHowever, the young I soon discovered that some dimensions of difference do carry social significance. As a child who did not play with “boys’ toys” and identified as gay later, I was often subjected to disdain and hostility from peers and adults. Ironically, the marginalization comes not only from society at large, but also from within the gay community. A feminine gay man is considered as lesser than his masculine counterpart, because femininity is regarded as weak, unattractive, and second-class. This experience of amplified minority stress prompted me to think about intergroup and intragroup interaction early in life. It has led me to believe that masculinity should not be an indicator of individual worth. Nor should sexuality, skin color, and other identity markers—whether visible or invisible.\n",

  "text": "The Alhambra\n\nThe Alhambra is a beautiful palace which is situated in Granada, in the south of Spain. Its historical importance lies in the fact that this place represents the fall of the Muslim kinddom in my country. The Catholic Monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinad, had tried for several years to defeat the muslims, who at this time, only remained seated in the city of Granada. The Alhambra Palace was the residence of Boabdil, the last Muslim king, who was defeated in 1492 after delivering Granada to the Catholic Monarchs.\n\nNowadays, this palace is one of the most visited places here in Spain because of its beauty and its impressive courtyards. You can see the history of the Reconquets in its walls and towers. Its surroundings are also wonderful, and the city invites you to spend more time in the Alhambra, one of the last Muslim palaces in the word. ",

An event started at 7 p.m. but all the volunteers who had signed a contract had to work from 8 a.m. Everything has to be perfect during such events so we had no time to relax or even eat a decent meal! The whole process of selling the tickets was fascinating because of the demand for them. People looked like aggressive monsters and I realised that they are close to kill their every single 'rival'. Security guards had a lot of work to do but thanks to them we stand a chance to deal with other problems, as for example regulating the quality of sound. I was incredibly overjoyed when the culmination came. A band was playing, we were enjoying music and it seemed that there will be no more complications. What you actually think in such an extraordinary moment is that life couldn't be more beautiful.\n\nTake care, Paul. When you come to my town, we'll go out to a rock concert together!

  "text": "Hi Paul,\n\njust a quick answer to your request. I don't have much time, because I'm taking off in 10 minutes to help at another concert. \n\nSo, the deal is, I met this guy in the bar, Ron, and we started talking. After a few drinks I told him that I'm currenly looking for a job, nothing big, just a couple of hours during weekends to gather some money for my journey to Netherlands. Remember, I told you about it last time, when we met Jenny. Anyway, it turned out that the guy works in this agency, they organise concerts, parties and stuff like that, and he offered me the job! The perfect one! It's literally 10-15 hours on Fridays nights and Saturdays, stuff like carrying instruments (which means hanging out with musicians), tyding after (finding things, like wallets and cellphones) and generally speaking - helping.\n\nLast week I worked most time with the manager of The Kooks. I went to Krakow and spent all day \"planning\" their stay in Poland. In fact I had to be everywhere with the guy, just hanging and helping him not to get lost in the city. He's a really nice guy, during the concert we had a few drinks, smoked some fags together. I tell you, I meet so many people nowadays that I don't even remember their names.\n\nThe salary is nice too. Usually I get 12 PLN per hour (yeah, I know, It's like 2,50 pounds, but here it's quite good) but sometimes I get some extra money for staying after hours or when I do something unusual to help. Last time it was for example delivering my drunk boss home ;)\n\nI have to go now. Take care and call me on Skype tomorrow - I'll tell you so much more, I have plenty of unbelievable stories!\n\nCheers,\nArek",

  "text": "A modern interpretation of Austen's Classic Love Story\n\nThe glorious world of Jane Austen is brought back to the silver screen in Pride & Prejudice, a 2005 British film based on the novel of the same title, published in 1813.\nJoe Wright directs this uplifting adaptation, which depicts the five Bennet sisters, who have been brought up to get married. The enthusiastic and clever Elizabeth stands out among them striving to put everything in a broader perspective. However, their whole lives will be turned upside down when an elegible bachelor and his friends set up home in a close mansion. Surprisingly enough, sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) meets single, rich, and proud Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). All in all, will each one be able to overcome their own pride and prejudice?\nKeira Knightley, in the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet, delivers an outstanding performance. In fact, the film, well cast from top to bottom, is highlighted by a compelling soundtrack and a set of beautiful English locations, as in many British productions.\nIn this adaptation, the screenwriter makes some substantial alterations to the novel. Therefore dialogues, settings as well as politeness, costumes and hairstyles are meant to give it greater public appeal, sacrificing historical accuracy. Thus, overlapping dialogues are introduced in a mixture of modern idiom and archaic sentence structure, several scenes have been shifted to more romantic settings, and the proximity of the Bennets to their rural life is stressed to illustrate their relative poverty in contrast with the rich characters of the story\nTo conclude, Pride & Prejudice is an amazing adaptation which completely bewitches you with an exquisite blend of emotion and wit. In fact, in its final minutes, it makes you believe, for one misty-eyed moment, in true love and in order reigning in the universe. By the way, if you haven’t seen this romantic, funny, well-acted and well-scripted film yet; give it a try!",

It is an oil painting, painted on poplar wood. The painting is most famous for the smile of the woman, which people have been trying to decipher for a long time. Many believe that the portrait is that of DaVinci himself, while many also place a lot mystic connections with this painting.\n\nThe portrait depicts a woman's bust, with a distant landscape that is visible in the backdrop. Leonardo used a pyramid design to install the woman in a simple and calm manner within the painting. The woman is shown with her hands folded, with her breast, neck, and face painted the same color as her hands. The light is diffused so that the various curves and geometrical shapes on the painting are made visible through it.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the painting is the woman's smile. Many believe that it is innocent and inviting, while others believe it is that of smugness and is a smirk. Many scientific studies have been undertaken to determine the exact nature of the smile and the real reason remains a mystery. It is believed that every person sees the smile differently because of the changes in the lighting that Leonardo presented.\n\nThe woman is shown seated in an open area, and behind her is a vast landscape, which recedes to an icy mountain. Some winding paths and a far away bridge is also perceptible in the background.\n\nThe painting is an amazing one and one should definitely take a look at it in order to appreciate its full beauty.

  "text": "Over the past few years, the Internet has become an important part of our lives. We use it to communicate with friends, to play games, to watch series, the list is endless. Unfortunately, it is not perfect. Because the more people use the Internet, the greater the chances are of people misusing it. Luckily, the government intervenes to preserve the safety of the Internet. What it comes down to is, should the Internet be more tightly controlled by governments?\n\nWithout the interference of the government, criminals may see their chances to take advantage of internet users. They could get into our computers and steal our information. They could use that information to get into our bank accounts and steal our money.\n\nHowever, if the government were to monitor the citizens actions more closely, it would be considered an invasion of our privacy. Nobody wants to have their private data to be exposed to the eyes of the government. \n\nThis brings me to the next issue. The reason why the government even take action is to ensure people are able to enjoy the internet, but a more tightly controlled internet would destroy that purpose. Everybody likes to have the freedom to explore the internet. So they would not appreciate it if there were suddenly restrictions put on them.\n\nTo sum things up, the government should not control the internet more tightly. It is fine the way it is right now. That way, the most of the trouble would be kept away from the internet while at the same time, the internet users would still have the freedom to explore the web.\n",

  "text": "Are people born violent or do they become violent because of how they are brought up? How did we become the person we are?  Is there something that makes us unique? Is it the genes we are born with? Or are we a product of our own lives? \nIt is clear that genes play a very important part in the person we are. Family characteristics such as eye and hair colour are inherited by children from their parents as well as some diseases and mental disorders. Therefore, what we need to consider is whether our personality and personal skills are born or made. \nThose who hold that nature has a stronger influence than nurture on developing our personal identity will claim that certain personality traits are also determined by our genes. Nevertheless, identical twins that were separated when they were very young and have been raised in different environments show differences in their personalities. This provides evidence that life experiences and surrounding where you grow up have defined the kind of person you are today.\nRegarding personal skills, there are a large number of cases in which children were born gifted for the same field as their parents having great potential for a specific art or science since early childhood. However, nature doesn´t always endow us with inborn abilities. For instance, parents tend to instil their own passions in their children and, consequently, they will likely be interested in the same academic or artistic field. According to this fact, parents often shape their children´s lives encouraging them to follow in their footsteps. Likewise, some people put their success in life down more to their parent´s training than to their innate talents. \nSo, to conclude we would have to argue that both nature and nurture make us who we are. As I see it, personal identity is the result of the interaction of our genetic structure and the environment which surrounds us. The problem is how to separate these two influences and how to find out which the strongest is in each case. \n",

  "text": "Dear Ira!\n\nThanks a lot for your letter. It was fun to read as always. Your new friends seem to be crazy guys, in a good way, of course. \n\nI was so surprised to hear you signed up for a new interior design course because it’s such a coincidence that I’m planning to do something with my bedroom in the near future. As I’ve got some extra money at last, I think It’s high time for me to think how to make it cozy and comfortable. I hope you don’t mind if I ask you some questions.  \n\nFirst, I think about painting the walls in warm colors (apricot, salmon or warm beige). I thought you might add some more interesting colors to the list. Do you think a wall mural is a good decision for the bedroom and what other «special effects» would you recommend? I completely rely on your taste as we’ve always been on the same wavelength.\n\nNow, the toughest questions. I’ve got no clue what to do with  the ceiling. The idea of  painting it white seems too boring to me and I’m completely out of my depth with all this new stuff for ceilings in shops, but I’m sure you’re an expert! The floor is also a problem. I want it to look beautiful, be easy to wash and not expensive at the same time. I’m wondering what you would suggest.\n\nI hope I don’t bother you too much with my redecoration, knowing how busy you are. \n\nCan’t wait to hear what you’ve been up to this weekend.\n\nAll the best\n\nNatasha\n",

  "text": "CONVENIENCE IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT\n\nNowadays, every one of us travels a lot. We do that for work or to finally get a rest. I, as a young women, usually travel just as a hobby. Since the technology has improved in recent years, we now have a huge variety of different ways to travel. Is it possible to choose which one is the best?\nThe most common answer would be probably the plane. There are so many advantages. It is the fastest and the most comfortable one. Of course, for these facilities you have to pay a lot of money and that could be a problem for some people.\nThe next one is boat. It could also be really comfortable but we don't use it often. It's more for exotic trips. Travelling on a boat for sure is a great adventure. But there is also an inconvenience - it is also expensive. And it is hard to plan a trip like this.\nWhat about the train then? This is the best option for me. In my country trains aren't really fast and there could be problems during the trip but that's for me makes it more interesting. During the trip you can do many things - from sleeping to meeting new people and making fun. It is also quite safe so you don't have to worry about the accidents.\nI wish I could travel every day. The trip is an adventure and the ways you can travel are a big part of it. Even though any mode of transportation is not bad, for me the train is the best option.",

  "text": "back in 2010, I traveled from Porto Alegre to Sao Paulo by car, a course that took 18 hours driving straight, surely very few people would consider it convenient. \ncars are handy and driving can be pleasant, but only when the driver is in good mood, with no traffic jams or craters on the road( really common situations in Brazil). Since ancient times exist public transport, and it suffered numerous attempts of assassination, in China for example, the dynasty Yuan prohibited public transport (at that age, charriots) because of fear that Han people could plot and riot against mongol's dictatorship in it; the situation inverted at early socialist regime when, in 1960, Mao considered personal cars as instrument of opression and symbol of devilish capitalism. Of course, none of these radical measures last long against the very basic human instinct: laziness.\nwe have cars so we don't have to walk, in the same fashion, people who can't afford a car will want public transport, even if a bike could be the solution. The convenience has litlle to do with the fate of public transport, countries with high HDI(convenience to be drivers), like Germany and England, are those with better public transport system, and they are even boosting it. \nUnless some extraordinary mutation happens and change us to some labor-lovers, personal cars and public transport will rule side by side for all eternity.

There are near to France and Andorra. There are lots of ski stations with good ski slopes of different levels with different colours, the greens are the easiest and blacks are the most difficult. \nMontmeló: \nIn Catalonia there is an important race track where the cars of Formula 1 race. When there isn’t any race you can go and try different racing cars or if you want you can go and race a bike on the race track.  \nConclusion:\nTo sum up I think that if you want to do exciting sports Catalonia is a good place where you can find lots of different sports and you can choose what to do, but if you don’t want to do sports you can do another activities or go on interesting places. \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

Meanwhile, Mark and Michael were talking with Russian ladies, they were beautiful and flawless, the scientists started talking about science and that sort of thing, and suddenly the ladies vanished, the men started crying. Jack, was arguing with an officer about Mexico conquest (the officer didn’t understand anything because Jack was drunk), and suddenly, the officer took off his costume and a strange mask, and in that moment… Jack was astonished because the officer was not an officer, he was Brad! Jack tried to confront him, but as soon as he tried to do that, he snapped his fingers and a lot of people came around him, he had a new team, he decided to name them “The KM-3J”, a villains team, their names were Karolina (she decided to change his name like that because he used to say that that letter was her favorite one), Melanie, Miley (they were both twins, the most beautiful ladies of the world), Max, who was an expert in the military field, and Brad Rowley J., nobody had known his last name until that moment: Junior, he was embarrassed about it, he was descendant of a weird woman, however she was her mother.\nThe KM-3J put Jack into an immense bag, they were planning to kill him and place his dead body in a grave, in that way their friends would find him buried, but they were not that evil, they just put him into a dark room and tied his hands in a chair, it was exactly the same thing he was dreamed about. While Jack was there, he heard Brad talking with Max about their new plan, it was related to a gigantic weapon that would shoot toxic wastes at New York city, so in that way, everybody would become a zombie. The bulk of the population from New York was homeless because there has just been a horrible war between New York City and California, however, increasingly refined body technologies allowed New York to win the war. Jack was frightened, but suddenly he heard the door opening and saw their friends rescuing him, they had used some weapons from The King of the Sky, they got into the room and started shooting while Michael was unleashing Jack from the chair, accidentally, Mark killed Miley while he was shooting, all her body parts were scattered on the floor, he didn’t care about and flew with the others. Jack fainted while their friends were rescuing him.\nWhen they arrived at mainland, Jack woke up, there wasn’t anyone around him, there was just sand and the beach…\n",

  "text": "Comfort, time and internal peace are required to make learning efficient. Hence, it is not possible to do job and study side by side. Occupation and education disturb one another. I strongly oppose this statement because handling both these together is easily possible with strong willpower. I will elaborate points to support my opinion in the further paragraphs.\n\nFirstly, there are a lot of people in western countries, who do a part-time study and work full-time or vice-versa. It all depends on the preference of the individuals. If they want to bear some hassle and become more productive in their life, they can manage both things side by side. This not only makes them knowledgeable but increase their potential as well. \n \nSecondly, there are a few parents who cannot bear the expenses of their child’s education. Resultantly, they put their children into some labor so that they can earn money for the family. But it does not mean that the child has to abandon his dream of acquiring education. With firm determination, they can continue their education and work to feed their family as well.\n\nFinally, sometimes people think they have completed their education, but when they get a full-time job, they realize that diploma or degree can increase their chances of promotion. Moreover, some employers select the potential employee from colleges while they are studying and pay for their Masters or Advanced Diplomas because they see their profit in that investment. Hence, studying and working side by side helps candidates to grow professionally.\n\nIn conclusion, working and studying is very much possible. It just depends on the dedication and determination of the person. People should do both study and work side by side to make themselves more skilled and capable.",

I’d been set up.  Duped, so to say, into this unlikely event, a date night.  Her plan was so clever and deceptive as to escape detection until the last card had been played.  \nOh, my wife is clever.  When exactly did the deception begin?  Was it the party which lasted until 3am the night before? Was it at the invitation to the wedding three weeks ago?  How far back could it possibly go.  When was this seed planted in my wife’s brain to have a date night with me all dressed up and formal? \nSo many twists and turns-she played her cards well, I never suspected while sitting in the pews next to my wife that when she leaned forward with a pained expression on her face that the evening would end at D’el Arte.  Nor when her condition appeared to worsen and I decided to go get the car to take her to the doctor’s office, nor when I returned to find her lying on the cold hard stone floor of the church could I have ever imagined we would be enjoying a quiet evening together sharing entrees and desserts.  Nor could I have conceived after having multiple people help calling the ambulance, which never came, or the friends who called my in-laws to come take care of the kids, that we would be eating a wonderful pizza by the end of the evening.

I am fourteen years old and interested in this job and believe I have the qualifications.\n I think I would be fit for this job, because I am young, energetic, enthusiastic and have always enjoyed working with children.\nI can speak English since I used to vacation in Australia as a child. I would be helpful in the kitchen as I used to work part-time in my uncle's restaurant. I grew up with two younger brothers and used to look after them therefore I am used to dealing with younger kids.

Like the one I had in 1926 and all because of a parachute.\n     It was a foggy January morning and I had gone to renew my pilot's licence.  The weather report said the ceiling was at 180 metres. But at 360 metres, I was still surrounded by heavy fog. Suddenly my plane began to act up, I was losing control. I sent the plane into a deep dive and landed safely. I looked at the plane and realized I forgot to tie the parachute cord to the plane. Thank God I didn't jumped or I would have been a 'dead duck' for sure!",

  "text": "Dear Paul, \n\nLast month, as you may know, I was a volunteer on occasion of my favourite band's concert in Katowice. It was just a miracle - it had turned out that the band's manager was my good old friend Daniel and he asked me for help when he found out I was a big fan of the group. Although the work was truly demanding and lasted for quite a while, I must say I really enjoyed it. \nAt first I had to be involved in it a month before the event was started. I was asked to give some information about the concert to local pubs, restaurants etc. so I was handing leaflets everywhere. \nBy the time the event was upcoming, I had to take over the band's equipment. I had to move it from place to place along with boys from the group. One thing leads to another and we ended up having a beer and laughing in a pub. \nEventually the concert came off just perfectly! Lots of people showed up, everybody had fun and the best thing in the musical experience is that you can make friends with famous people and those who you admire and only see on TV. If you will ever have an opportunity to help by this kind of event, I recommend it to you from the bottom of my heart! \nLooking forward to hearing from you. \n\nYours sincerely, \nPatrycja.",

It's a pity that you have to choose between the activities that you love the most, but I guess that life is full of choices. If I were you, I would give up music and I am going to explain why. You have always wanted to be policewoman (unless you have recently changed your opinion) so you must be very fit since you need to pass the physical tests, which are very demanding, according to my mother. Sport is something essential to get this goal and you can always practise music at home when you have some free time (yes, I know that it happens once in a month). \nMoreover, you wrote to me that you have started to give lessons about guitar so you are not going to be isolated from music and it goes on playing an important role in your life. So I think you shouldn't be upset because now it is a difficult period, I know, but it passes and we can get back our life when we go to university. My cousin, who is studying English Literatura, told me that you have much more freedom when you start university, so don't worry!\nI hope you write to me when you make the final decision, I look forward to hearing from you.",

  "text": "The oldest memory of our relationship is a short skirt and some crocodiles. Two perfect stigmas for a man and a woman in general. The task is unambiguous and seemingly easy. I should be able to describe my view of American man and his behavior because of my experience as an adult, a woman, a wife, a mother and simply a human being with various roles in life who has been million times happy and million times unhappy. However, I am non-American and I live with a man who surprises me every day in a positive and also in a negative way. I cannot describe my own husband. Is it really possible to describe a man at all? No. I think that I can depict this one American man within a certain period of time, but it is impossible to write the truth since I have never seen him alive. I can write subjectively and my observations of him through the Internet will be distorted by my own life, experience and surrounding I live in. Let me introduce one American I got friends with on Facebook. His name is Kyle. A typical American name, right? However, he is not typical. He is special. I like his humor, because he is able to make me smile. His sensitivity is visible through his carefully chosen words and his decency in his grammatically correct sentences. I adore his imagination because he is able to kidnap you on a cloud to a never never land. He is wise and brave, because he was not scared to teach me although he is not a teacher. But what about those snakes and guns in his photos? Would I be able to overcome my own phobias and be fair? And what about those open-hearted quotes, love songs and poetic opinions he shares on his wall? Is he a romantic and a killer in one? He is the man stuck in a generation where loyalty is just a tattoo, love is just a quote and lying is the new truth. He is the man and I am the woman who live in the world, in which the man wears a short skirt and the woman is as tough as a crocodile.\nHe always writes gentle words, uses cute smileys, Facebook kisses and hugs, but when I ask him in what way he loves me, he answers \"as a Christian\". Well, it´s all right. I´m relieved. However, the woman inside of me shouts: What? He does not love me as a woman! How come! I would like to point out another his attribute which is his pride. When I asked him, if he had read a book The Little Prince by Exupéry because I am feeling like a fox, he asked me in an offended manner, if I know Larry, the comedian. Kyle is really prideful, but so are all the men. I don´t believe in the friendship between the man and the woman. There will always be some kind of sparkling either alluring or repulsing. \nNext thing I like about him is that he never pushes me into anything. If I want to sleep, he stops his own imagination to let me relax and rest. So he is thoughtful. \nI must be honest for a while. He rose up my own enslaved desires. I have always wanted to fly, to travel, to paint, to write and to love. And I am left to love without any support. He asked me to observe him for a week. However, I am scared a bit of the consequences of this secret adventure. What if it breaks me down? I mean what if he tames me like a fox? He is a hunter. All the men are.\nIn following section I will write about his sexuality and dealing with an argument. It was easy to draw him into the love affair or to make him horny, but it was quite difficult to start an argument with him. I think that he is a good writer because he is able to describe his sexual dreams and thoughts lively and vividly. However, ask him a question from his real life and he will give you a one-word answer. This could hardly satisfy an ordinary questioner like me, not only an interviewer from a daily journal.\nI believe he is tender and careful, but impatient and clumsy at the same time. He forgets of everything when he plunges into his Neverland. No matter what you write, he follows his own lust. On the other hand,he is disciplined, because he is able to stop with his imagery at once. He is cute, anyway. \nAs I wrote before it was not that easy to make the argument with him. I tried to use different strategic inputs that could help me to argue, for example: You are totally uninterested to read between lines! You never listen to me!I even called him a lummox and stumblebum. He just kept quiet and begged me to stop. He did his best to calm me down. I was impressed and I find this a good feature of his personality. \nYesterday I wanted him to tell me the story of his life. He went with the trip from California to Texas and then to Phoenix. If you like adventurers, well, he is the right man for you. \nSport is a part of men. I should not bypass this issue. So I asked him what his favourite sport is.He likes baseball, but he does not play baseball actively. He likes watching it. He actively does hiking, hunting and camp riding. \nThe week has passed, so we are at the end of this adventure course. Kyle is a strong and charismatic individuality and he values his privacy a lot. Honestly, I asked myself, if I would like to be his future wife. I pondered this many times. And surely, I will. However, I am not that crazy to marry the man whom I not know in real life. But I do like him and I loved the course. It surely taught me a lot and enriched my whole life. Thank you, Kyle. \nIn the end, I would like to add a quotation by Franz Marc. I do not know who Franz Marc is. But I identify myself with his view of male and female relationship. \"Blue is the male principle, stern and spiritual. Yellow the female principle, gentle, cheerful and sensual. Red is matter, brutal and heavy and always the colour which must be fought and vanquished by the other two.\"",

  "text": "To: The Chairperson\nFrom: Teodora Costescu, Romanian student\nSubject: Local Environmental Protection\nDate: 13th September 2014\n\nPurpose\nAs requested, this is a report concerning the environmental condition within my town. The information below evaluates the chief measures taken against pollution and environmental damage as well as the population’s interest and involvement in an optimum preservation of the area.\n\nRecycling\nThrough a series of programmes and events organised by local voluntary organisations both adults and children are instructed about the importance of waste reduction and recycling. Therefore, in the last few years there has been a great improvement in raising awareness and commitment among an increasingly larger sector of the population as far as the selective collection of household refuse is concerned. This is clearly illustrated by the growing number of recycling facilities the residents of our town have at their disposal. \n\nPublic Transport\nSince exhaust fumes are considered to be one of the major pollutants nowadays, the local authorities are doing everything in their power in order to induce citizens to travel more by means of public transport, in the detriment of the ubiquitous private cars. Consequently, there are buses which run at short intervals on various routes, so that people can arrive at their destinations rapidly and conveniently. Unfortunately, only a limited number of people are willing to leave their comfort zone for the sake of the community, thus making pollution by dint of heavy traffic a remaining and inextricable problem of our society.\n\nPublic Cleaning Services\nOur local public cleaning services are responsible not only for the efficient removal, storage, collection and transport of waste material, but also for the maintenance and good care of natural areas and green spaces within our community. The sole purpose of their activity is to keep our town clean and neat, making it an appealing and pleasurable place to inhabit.\n\nConclusion\nTaking everything into consideration, it would be fair to conclude that there are numerous ways in which one can protect the environment and take care of the area in which they reside. However, as with all issues present within society, a dual commitment from the citizens and authorities should be regarded as a key factor.\n     \n\n\n",

  "text": "  Red fire ants originated in Brazil.\n  Fire ants are very aggressive. They often swarm on their prey swiftly and sting repeatedly to paralyze it. If we disturb a fire ant nest they would relentlessly sting us, injecting poison into our body. The sting could be fatal if we have an allergy. Even if we don't, stinging will cause a burning sensation, swelling and then a blister at the point of sting. In mild cases, the sting causes itch. In severe cases it causes nausea, vomiting or dizziness. In the US, millions of people are stung annually and some have died from their injuries.\n  Fire ants threaten more than human health.

  "text": "here will be several inventions in the next years. Nowadays we can't predict the aim of future devices though I guess that they will be mainly related to eradicating current illnesses. Cancer, for instance, is surely one of the preferences for the companies that invest large amounts of money in R&D. Moreover, it is a profitable task if they make up new medications to help people suffering from that illness. Personally, I consider curing cancer the most challenging goal for the next generation of researchers and inventors. \n\nAlthough I advocate new remedies for cancer, I think that there is another problem in the world that society should focus on. It does not fit in rich countries because it concerns to poor countries. It is usually forgotten because it barely affects our daily routine. However, when we talk about hunger we must regard it as the main problem of the world.  That is the reason why I have been thinking for a long time about a new device to eradicate starvation. It is not completely developed but I can advance some ideas about its design.\n\nIt consists of a pill where we blend lots of different elements. Altogether they provide the nutrients to cover the needs of feeding of one person in one day. Manufacturing costs are not expensive and these pills do not expire. They can be conserved for a long time and shipping costs are very low.\n\nI consider that it could contribute to feeding many people and it could definitely end with the most unfair problem of this world.",

  "text": "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL\n\nThere must be something very special about a movie  when, after the third time, you’re still getting out of the cimena thinking“ I have to see it again”. That’s only happened to me once, and the film was Life is Beautiful.\n\nStarring Italian comic Roberto Begnini (who also wrote and directed the movie) in the main role of  Guido, this live loving  tragic/comedy it's about a Jewish father trying to shield his young son from the horrors of the nazims in the Italy of Mussolini.   \n\nFor that matter Guido creates an imaginariy game for his child once they are deported to a concentration camp.  He tells the boy that they are competing with others to win a tank, so the little Guiosué didn’t realise what it’s really going on around him. \n\nThe strength of the movie relies on the goofy, loving, eccentric character played by Begnini, his exceptional comic talent and his ability as director to deal with such delicate topic like Nazism while  managing to drive through a thick line bettween comedy and drama. The Original soundtrack created by Nicola Piovanni it's also a beautiful,  delicate plus to this masterpiece. \n\nLife is beautiful was recipient of numerous awards including three Oscars as for best foreign picture, best actor and best original dramatic score.\n\nWhat strikes me  more was that despite the fact that it’s set on the eve of the II world war,  the film isn’t really about the holocaust but a bittersweet fable about human courage love and hope. If you already haven’t seen it , which I doubt, I highly recommend it;   it will make you laugh out loud but also along the way you’ll find yourself cover in tears, Guarantee.\n",

  "text": "Football, to me, is more than just a game. I have learned a lot of things from it.\n\nWhen I joined the team freshman year, I didn’t realize what I was getting into. Football requires tremendous amounts of teamwork and sportsmanship to be successful. We worked all summer in the weight room and ran on the track to get in physical and mental shape before the season. \n\nSee, football is more of a mental sport than anything else, so running on the track wasn't only about getting in shape. We would push our minds by running as hard as we could even if we felt like we were going to pass out. At the beginning, I was immature and only thought of myself, sometimes even giving up when I was tired or hurting. Then after the third game I had a season-ending injury. Imagine working all summer and then only being able to play three games! I needed surgery on my arm and at least five months to recover. \n\nNeedless to say, I was sidelined for the rest of the season, but this actually helped me realize that since you never know when your last play will be, you should try your hardest in football and life.\n\nAfter freshman year I decided that I would always give my best effort. Playing varsity football has taught me so much more than just what my assignments are on a particular play or how to block. I have learned to think about others first, and realized how important working hard is. Being with all my friends, even sweating and bleeding with them, really made us bond as a group of hard-working young men I know will succeed in life.\n\nHigh-school football is more than just a sport. It is a learning ground for many to strengthen their personality and character for their lives. One thing my coach always says is, “Imagine that you have just run 100 sprints and a giant bear starts chasing you. Are you just going to stand there and let it attack you because you are too tired?” The answer, of course, is no, because you can always put it in another gear even if you think you need to give up. This to me means that you can always control your attitude and effort. So, no matter what, if you maintain a great attitude and always give whatever you’re doing your best effort, you will have no regrets.",

We could move the search bar closer to the top in order to make it easier to find. Besides, adding a schedule to the left section would be an advantage, as our customers would be able to find the option they need in a more convenient way. \nSecond, the theme is outdated, and developing new design can be a good move to attract more clients. Minimalistic design is both stylish and user-friendly, as it does not imply any elements requiring website visitors to load heavy modules, and there are no unnecessary banners that distract the user. \nThird, implementing several advanced solutions, such as a calculator, a gallery and live chat, could make our page more useful. \nAs to other aspects of our website, it might be a good idea to enhance its performance by means of optimizing the code and removing advertisements (which decrease the website value while bringing little profit). \nAll these tasks can be completed within a month, and I would be glad to be involved in the improvement of our website, as it is an important aspect of our work, because it represents the company, and representation is key when attracting clients is concerned.

  "text": "Before focusing on the topic of technology itself, I would like to mention some aspects related to education.\nFirst of all, Spanish educational laws are in Europe, and probably in the world, the only ones which have changed the most in the last 30 years. This fact leads the teachers to be unsure of what they are doing. Besides, there are no results that can be analysed or checked.\nSecondly, there are two sorts of schools in Spain-public and private-, which produces a big difference in the educational knowledge. While public ones must obey governmental laws strictly, private schools have some privileges.\nKnowing this about the Spanish education system, we can now talk about technology. I obviously agree that nowadays technology is necessary. So, the schools and the educational institutions in general have to update the way they teach. Technology does not imply a new instrument to be taught but a new tool and source of knowledge (if used correctly). In fact, using technology without changing the contents would be a total failure. \nTeachers must learn how to use these new technological devices in order to get their students motivated. Moreover, they should comprise the past information and the new one. Thus, this would help students know how the world has evolved and how it will be. In other words, technology should be used as a tool for the students be aware of the development of society and its advantages and disadvantages.\nThis new technologies also help in the teaching development. We can make dynamic classes by being in contact with other schools, in the case of subjects such as English and French, students would improve their skills by being in contact with students from different countries. Also, teachers could replace their methodologies following the best ones and the ones which contribute to have qualified students trained to face everyday life situations.\nIn conclusion, as a great teacher said, we have 21st century students learning with 20th century tools the 19th century knowledge. Thus, there must not be a technological revolution but an educational one. ",

I fear that such a huge move would damage businesses and many workers would lose their jobs.\nAt present, I am working for Cafe Noir, a well-known restaurant popular with visitors, many of whom have told me that if such a ban were introduced, they would would not enter into restaurants and instead, they would meet friends at home.\nOn top that, I think the amount of notice you have given people is unreasonable. There needs to be much wider public debate, and if a majority agree, they should be given enough time to get used to.\nTo support my argument, I would like to tell you what happened in my country when such a ban was introduced. First, it was almost impossible to enforce it. There were not enough police to go round checking any public place. Secondly, business suffered, with people objecting that they should be given the right to smoke if they wished. In the end, the government changed the law, encouraging people to provide non-smoking areas.\nThis approach strikes me as much more realistic and I urge you to reconsider it before it is too late.",

  "text": "   We will talk about a technology that might soon disturb the world. But first let me explain the process taken to manufacture anything. The manufacturing process follows three main stages: designing then producing then consuming. For a quick glimpse, this technology provides the ability to precisely clone any tangible object. This directly affects the producing stage, allowing more efficient production.\n    More efficient production means cheaper goods, and by providing them cheaper the consumer now has the ability to purchase more of these goods. Higher purchasing power means that we can buy more goods using the same amount of money. In other words, money would have more value. So, let's say, you have $100,000 now, you would have $10,000,000 fifty years from now. You then could pay your debt, get a new car, buy a new house, invest or retire, or do just about anything you would do if you currently have $10,000,000 in your bank account. Looking at it through a broader scope, country deficits would be solved, hungry people would be fed, and the homeless would get accommodated.\n    But why would the goods be cheaper? This is the effect of a reduction in the cost of production; less production cost allows the producer to reduce the price of his goods while maintaining the initial profit. With competition giving him no choice at all, the producer is forced to abide by the market equilibrium. Surprisingly, the producer get to maintain his profits due to the proportional decrease in price as well as the cost to produce. This automatic, efficient, quick, precise technology reduces the amount of labor needed, saves waste initially caused by human errors, saves time and produce at better quality too.\n    In conclusion, this revolutionary technology has potential to vastly improve the way we manufacture our goods, and in the process of doing that benefit the whole world.\n",

  "text": " After a Year…\n\nYou can never really say a thing is worst unless you have indulged yourself in it. You can never really say a situation is unfortunate unless you have already been to it. And you can never really say a teacher in the mountain is miserable unless you have experienced being one. \nWhen I knew I would be assigned at Gala National High School, I said it’s the worst thing that ever happened to my career. When I knew I would be teaching at the remotest high school in Ozamiz, I said I was so unfortunate, and when I knew I would be spending my days in the mountain, I said my life would be miserable. Indeed, negative vibes filled my thoughts after having known that I was to practice my chosen profession in the place I feared the most. \nBut after a year, I was all wrong. \nMy first paragraph aptly expresses my exact realization. To have been assigned in the mountain is never a worst situation; I have never been unfortunate, and misery has never been my colleague. In fact, being a teacher in the mountain is being the best of who I am, being the most fortunate of men alive, and being the happiest I could ever be. \nYes, Gala National High School has given me thousands of reasons to be happy and to feel blessed. In here, I have learned more than the lessons I have taught. The school as a whole has become my great mentor. It has taught me lessons I couldn’t have learned had I not been here - the lessons that do not only help me improve my teaching profession but also help me become the right person of my ministry. Gala has paved the way for me to become that teacher I long to see. I may have been far yet from being an ideal one, but I know someday, having Gala as my guiding light, I can become one.\nAs to my colleagues, I am grateful to be in a small group of individuals who most of the time shares the same line of interest with me. We are so small a number, but that does not hinder us to hold any school program and activity at its best. With our sheer creativity and enthusiasm, we always made it a point that every school activity is worthwhile. We never settled for any mediocrity. That is us – the teachers of Gala. And that’s one thing I love the most. Together, we aspire for something beyond better. \nMy personal relationship with my co-teachers is the same as that of a typical Filipino family. It’s not all the time that we are in good terms, but we know to ourselves that we care for each other. I may have hurt some of my colleagues in a certain circumstance, and they may have hurt me too, but at the end of the day, it’s always camaraderie among us that dominates. And it’s all that matters. \nAs to my students, I feel really so fulfilled. At first, it was an extreme challenge for me to handle students in the mountain. Their needs speak beyond intellectual hunger. Every day I got to deal with students wearing different faces of life’s resentment. As a teacher, it took me much of everything I have to come to terms to every pitiful fate of my students. Hence, the value of UNDERSTANDING the students even beyond what the meaning of such word can express has been dramatically instilled in me. And that’s one of the lessons I consider a gem to keep to myself forever. \nStudents in the mountain have a lot of different untold stories of their lives. These stories once heard, can open somebody’s heart to learn to love learners despite everything. That is what exactly happened to me. As I listened to my students, I have come to realize the very essence of my existence as their teacher. Consequently, I have seen the need to attend to their needs. I may have not perfectly carried out my responsibilities, but I know somehow in my one year stay in Gala, I have made a difference to my students' lives. \nMy everyday interaction with my students has been my everyday fulfillment. Eventually, the huge challenge I have had has turned into my inspiration to do better in my job. My students have a lot of weaknesses in many aspects of life, but seeing them enduring was motivating me even more to give them good reasons to keep on keeping on. My dear students may have not known it, but really, they are too the source of my inner strength. There were times I wanted to back off from the many demands of work, but I always found myself fighting. I have more than enough reason to do that – and they are again, my students.\nIn a nutshell, Gala may have been very far, yet it my heart, it’s just within. The place, my colleagues, and my dear students are enough testimonies that in Gala I have found a home… and a family to love, really for real.",

  "text": "Dear Sir:\n\nIt is not an easy task to explain the importance of this exam for me, since I do not have any specific objective in mind that requires a Cambridge certification. Similarly, I do not have any study methods in the sense of systematic mechanisms to learn English. What I can say is that I have been learning English since I was twelve, and it has been a pleasure from the start.\n\nMy first memory related to the English language is of lyrics; I love pop music and used to translate songs composed by Elton John and Lennon and McCartney. Next I started to read books such as the Harry Potter series and books by George R. R. Martin. I am also an attentive listener of BBC Radio Four. These are my study methods, if I can say so.\n\nAbout the reasons to take the test, there is little to say. As I have said, I have been learning English by the sheer pleasure of it; but, having come this far, I think it is time to get some kind of formal recognition about my level.",

  "text": "What do people think about teenagers? Why rather negative?\n\nLots of people think, that teenagers are stupid, have a small knowledge about life, do not have enough experience, are annoying, difficult to understand. In my opinion we shouldn't think like that. I agree that some of young people behave really badly, they smoke, shout on their parents, drink beer, do not improve themselves. But most  of teenagers are even more intelligent than adults or erderly people. At school, at home they have to cope with lots of problems and try to solve them. I strongly disagree that they are not experienced. They sometimes have to help their friends or even their parents in difficult tasks like psychical problems, give them tips. Sometimes it happens that a couple, which has a child in age from 12-16, querls. The young person has to be strong, try to understand the situation.\nTennagers also have to make serious  decisions like choosing secondary school, future job, which way they will go in their life, if they want to be in relationship with someone. Those examples show that teenagers have to cope with lots of problems. Most of them are able to. Of course it's only my opinion.",

  "text": "Ways to collect and record information for future generations\n\nFinding the best way to collect and store information for the future is not just a problem in our working life but also in our private life. That is the reason why our class attended a panel discussion on this specific topic. Different ways of accumulating and storing information were presented at the discussion. I would like to emphasise two options in this essay.\n\nOne way to get the information needed is to interview people from the neighbourhood and either write down what is being said or record it as an audio-file. This way you do not only gather plain data but also emotions from people. Additionally, it happens that while speaking of a particular event suddenly more memories and stories come to the narrator’s mind. However, sometimes the narrator tends to fill in the gaps of his/her memory with imaginary parts or tries to embellish certain parts of the story.\n\nAnother interesting way to find out more about the past is to collect old photographs. This is an impressive way to document a change over many years, but on the other hand it is challenging to keep photographs in good condition.\n\nFor me personally, the best way to collect and record information for future generations is to interview people and to store the information in an appropriate way because of three reasons : Firstly, I have the chance of not getting just one story from a person but maybe two or three more. Secondly, I can catch the  the narrator’semotions. Thirdly, I do not have to be concerned about loss of qualitiy of photographs and pictures.\n",

Thus, more and more people, when buying a new car, also consider its environmental friendliness and the possible impact on the community. Also, cars get more affordable in many countries. For example, in India nd China the technological advances have enabled them to mass produce really affordable cars, which are also imported. Together with that, more people are getting familiar with driving and feeling more confident about driving their own car.

The lead actors were well known tv stars. The show was based on the journey of a married couple, living in India, who get separated due to some misunderstandings. The couple have 4 kids and after separation, 2 kids live with their mom and 2 with their dad. The dad, who is a cardiologist moves to US and starts a new life there.

The father who had vowed to never look back at first ignores her requests, however, upon insistence from his other children and his sister agrees to go back to India. The rest of the show is based on the interactions between all 4 children and how they work together to unite their family. It's a typical Indian soap opera in which love conquers over everything. Although not very practical, the show is fun to watch as it brings out the Indian values and at the same time teaches the importance of women being independent and able to lead life on their own.",

However, the attitude that I have is not very appropriate for entrepreneurship. It is important to underline that the driving factors (motivation) determine behaviour of entrepreneur and show the reasons for acting. In the test were accessed the answers and I was found out as a person that has high control appeal meaning that I have great leading skills and a need to organize and to moderate. In the motivation part I also received high score in need of challenges as I prefer to take difficult projects because I believe that they might develop my knowledge and abilities. Moreover, it is really important for me to be own boss even though it needs much more responsibilities. \nNevertheless, in the test I received fewer points in \"need for achievement/success\" than it was required for being an entrepreneur. As I found out there were two problems about lack of points. The first one was based on profit orientation of the entrepreneur in the test. The above-mentioned situation means that during the assessment were not taken into account other goals that entrepreneur might have. For instance, it can be the social sustainability and a need to develop the local employment situation or an entrepreneurship as a hobby/lifestyle. The second problem was based on essential role of getting a feedback. However, the test evaluated as important feedback parents and friends opinion and I do not agree that it might be essential unless they are specialists in that field.

  "text": "DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH IN SPAIN\n There has been major changes regarding the teaching approach in the last few years, but there is still room for improvement. If we focus on the teaching of English as a foreign language, we possibly could see this more clearly. In the early 1980s the activity in the classroom was focused on grammar. However, speaking, listening activities and the massive use of I.T mark the schedule nowadays. All these changes make the learning process much more fun, creative and practical for the students. \nThe new teaching approach is based on how students can effectively use the language rather than on the knowledge of the language they actually have. This new outlook on the teaching procedures consists of the use of the so called alternative assessment as a way to evaluate learners´ skills. A grammar test shows knowledge about the language, whereas alternative assessment shows learners´ ability to efficaciously use the language in the context of a real situation.\nThere are many reasons for using alternative assessment techniques: learners demonstrate things learned, take responsibility, motivation may increase and they have the opportunity to use language for actual purposes.\nIt is important to notice that the difficulty to carry out the changes towards the new teaching approach- referred to above- lies not with the students themselves but with the old generation of teachers, since they sometimes have trouble applying the new outlook on education methods.\nIn conclusion: The way of teaching is changing in the last few years all over Spain. The main reason for that could be found by overlooking the matters related to new teaching methods developed recently. However, a smooth transition to the new approach is still necessary to overcome the massive education-related challenges Spain will have to face in the upcoming years.\n",

  "text": "In the year 2020 there was conflict between Japan and the United states. The conflict was due to trend creation, citizens between both countries wanted to see who created better and bigger trends. This conflict was an incentive for clothing stores to sell new and weird things for a higher price. Law enforcers also wanted for their country to win, and in the United States policemen arrested any Japanese person they saw and sent them back to Japan. The Japanese government made a competition to see which of their citizens was the best trend-setter. The winner's reward was the ability to rule over Japan for a day. After two years, the winner was decided, and he made Japan go into poverty. Once the day was over, the Japanese government tried to reverse all of the damages done, but it was impossible. The winner had changed Japan's landscape, what once was the amazing city of Tokyo now was a sad and dirty city. Japan asked the United states for help, they gladly agreed, and they dragged Japan back up to their normal status. Japan lost a lot, but it was able to get back up on its feet. Everyone was happy for some time and true peace between the countries of the world had been achieved, but then the United States enslaved Canada and tried to enslave Japan as well, but they were able to defend themselves. Japan launched a counter attack and enslaved the United States, and then proceeded to conquer the world. A new era was created, it was the most brutal time period in the history of mankind, it was known as many things most people named it \"The Japan Era\", but it was so brutal that the official name was \"The Dark Yellow Era\" ",

  "text": "Many people believe that public transport will be replaced by private one in the nearest future. The main reason is the convenience of travelling by cars in comparison with using public transport. Apart from that, there are many other benefits in buying a car instead of using buses or underground every day.\n\nFirst of all, an automobile gives such a valuable thing as privacy. For example, driving a car we can wear whatever we want and listen to the music on any volume. If the car is large enough, it can be even a perfect place for sleep. Additionally, if we are eager to travel outside the town in order to have some rest from a hectic rhythm of life, it will be more comfortable for us to use our cars. Only our own vehicle can provide us with an opportunity to find any quiet and pleasant place outside the city. Public transport can take us just to certain locations. Thus, it is clear that private transport such as automobiles has plenty of advantages.\n\nOn the other hand, we can stuck with different problems while travelling by car. For instance, staying in traffic jams always steals much our precious time. Car accidents are the typical reason for this phenomenon. It means that travelling by cars can even be more dangerous than using public transport. Generally, bus drivers are much more experienced than automobile ones, therefore, accidents caused by public transport happen quite rarely. This makes travelling by public transport much safer. Thus, I would argue that driving a car requires much attention and understanding that careless behaviour on the road can make a serious damage to other people.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport will eventually lose its dominance due to the fact that all people want to be independent and travel on their own.

It was very enjoyable from the onset, and has been a fantastic experience to learn the sport together with other children. Another key factor was the coach, who knew how to convey the skills and techniques to children. \nMoreover, I was fascinated by the feeling of belonging to a team in which each member shares the same goals and values. This is an important feature that will also help anyone in all spheres of life. One also learns to work hard and disciplined in order to achieve success. All these points led to me playing basketball for almost thirty years now and I'm still hooked by it.  \nIf someone would ask me for advice on how to start playing basketball, I would probably suggest starting with a trial practise and if the person enjoys it, he/she can join the club. When choosing a club, I believe it's important that an experienced coach is present who knows how to teach the basics.\n  \nYours faithfully,\n\nF. ",

It is a different kind of restaurant, because you can find not only the typical Spanish food, also dishes from different parts of the world. \nWhat I like most of this restaurant is that it offers healthy and balanced food, the flavor is fantastic, the food very tasty and carefully cooked. You can enjoy original food, good quality on a budget.\nOn the other hand the surroundings are modern, the place is airy and cosy. The waiters are very welcoming and informative so you feel very comfortable. All the ingredients are very fresh and of the highest quality. In my opinion the salad is the best option, with a big range of types from different countries. My favorite one is the Italian salad, because it is healthy and the sauce they use is savoury and strange.\nFinally I really recommend this restaurant , especially for couples or friends that want to try something different and newfangled.\n",

I want to discuss the results of my research with everyone that is interested in it, from Brazil or from any other place in the world. Therefore, for me, writing in English, now, is more important than ever.\n\nI expect that this course will help me develop my English skills, so that I can write my papers, communicate and discuss my research in more effective way.

  "text": "  In modern world, public transport become less important as travelling by car is said to be more convenient. Travelling by car also reduces their time of journey and they don't need to wait for a particular bus. It may also because as people are getting richer they don't need to go for a public transport as more comfortable option is always there waiting for them.\n  Though public transport is more advantageous to the environment, people just want to get their personal needs satisfied. The world is moving faster and everyone has to be fast enough to compete with this modern world. While comparing the drawbacks of public transport with  modernized vehicles,public transport may not seems to be a better choice. But this is not true.\n  More usage of vehicles may cause serious problems such as depletion of natural resources and environmental issues such as pollution. Although the maintenance cost of car is quite expensive, it does not stop people from using cars since convenience matters to them the most and not money. Many people think that public transport is only for poor and not for rich. If it continues, no resource will be spared for the future generation.\n  Everyone should remember, \"Nature has enough resources to satisfy our needs, not our greed.\" ",

  "text": "Nowadays, many people around the globe are trying to acquire a second language, when it comes to decide between learning in our own country versus learning abroad, we can find several pros and cons that might get us fairly confused.\nOn the one hand, an advantage of studying in your own country is that you would be able to share with people with the same problems during their learning process as you. However, a major drawback would be the lack of exposure to the language that is intended to be learnt.\nOn the other hand, the most important advantage of studying abroad would be precisely, the exposure, which would help you understand the language from native speakers’ point of view and be aware of how some expressions or words are actually used. However, as a disadvantage, we must consider the cost of studying abroad, because it can be rather expensive.\nTo sum up, the best way of learning English, or rather the best place to do it depends on each person’s means and learning style, but definitely it is possible to acquire a second language both at home and abroad.\n",

People prefer to meet happiness and positive thinking then talking about a death and a suffering. They want to skip this day and move to Easter Sunday- the day of happiness and renewal. Accordingly, the author compares the Easter to a pagan spring festival, where people were joyful because of spring coming just as a Christians's cheerfulness of the Resurrection.\n\n2. We flinch from consideration of Good Friday because we do not like thinking of a sad situation. People choose pleasant entertainments instead of talking about a death, a suffering and a self-sacrifice. Today people are not willing to sacrifice themselves for other people. Everyone is individual and worries about themselves, because it is easier way to live. Above all, people are not used to undergo suffering and what is more brutal death.\n\n4. The author mentions the origin of the word 'compassion', in order to remind people the meaning of that word. It refers to 'suffer with'. Nevertheless, people make this compassion tided away, because it is too painful for them to stand that.

Even though I don't like places like that, I rather enjoyed this trip a lot. Maybe it was because I was with my friends and I could find many ways to spend my time with them or it could also be the great environment. I remember we got there the first of October on a Saturday night, and I will never forget the rush of warmth I felt as soon as I stepped out of the plane. First, I thought that it was something else causing the warmth, but later on I learned that the weather was like that all the time and I just had to get used to it. When we got to the resort we all checked in and went to our designated rooms. I was sharing a room with my friend Emily. After unpacking we left our room to see the rest of the resort. We found a club, 3 big pools, sports fields and, of course, the amazing beach, though we couldn't see much of it because it was really dark at night. The next day, we made sure to go to the beach early and we had a blast with our other friends. This went on until the last day of our trip. We were, obviously, sad because this amazing time was ending but happy as well for the memories we shared together. I will remember this vacation for the rest of my life.",

Last year I was in Canada and two years ago I fulfilled the same role in England. The groups I was in charge of mostly consisted of people from ages 6 to 12, although I once had the chance to work with a group of young adults as well.\n\nEverywhere I have worked before I have been praised for being very organised and having the ability to deal with unexpected situations successfully. I like to consider myself an energetic person. Usually, I don't have much time to spend on myself since I am always occupied with something. I have taken part of a basketball team since the age of 5 and I have recently become a young ladies' group's coach. As for my cooking abilities, I used to work as a kitchen assistant during the summertime. I did that for three summmers and I still help out at my parents' restaurant when a hand is in need. \n\nI would really appreciate it if you could take my application into account. If you do, I would also like to be sent the accommodation details, if possible, to the following address: 62Dssy7@gmail.com.

I don't know what exactly happens but in every World Cup the atmosphere changes, everybody gets happier, Mc Donalds launches the tastiest hamburgers, people go out to watch games with friends in bars or they meet in somebody's house.\n\nI love the World Cup despite the fact that it being in Brazil has brought a lot of political problems, or just show us how corrupt our government can be with the huge overpriced projects, a lot of money that has been spent on unfinished stadiums, with shameful delays in their construction, etc. I love the World Cup, however i certainly would have preferred if it had been in another country.\n",

It is very important to put some sunblock on your face, neck and hands. \n\nIn winter I go to run for half an hour in the afternoons, but in summer I go out and run in the mornings and in the afternoons to enjoy the nice weather.\n\nSometimes, you feel that you don't want to do it, but believe, once you put on your shoes, things change and you enjoy the running as you do it all the time.\n\nIt started a few years ago when I was a little overweight.

Talking from the outter look, one can easily see that Scout is not \"the usual\" girl. Scouts character is kind of a tomboy. She does not like to dress like a lady even when aunt Alexandra tries to make a lady out of her, Scout refuses to dress or speak like one.\nFrom the outside to her inner qualities. Scout is a really smart girl. In young age, before she went to school, she started reading. Her intelligence in young age was a Problem for her teacher Miss Caroline, because never had such a well-educated pupil before. Instead of celebrating it, she somhow inhibits Scouts learning. Due to that Scout gets bored and starts to hate school.\nFurthermore Scout often reacts very impulsive, mostly in young age. She goes after Walter Cunningham after she gets in trouble on his behalf. Also when she had trouble with her cousin, because she called Atticus a \"nigger-lover\" Scout beats her up. In the first part of the novel, fighting is a technique that works for Scout. For her it is a method to make her mind clear. Later on Scout begins to understand, not least because of her father and brother, that it is important to think before talking. Somehow she reverts back to her old ways.\nTo conclude Scout is a smart girl with two sides. On the one hand Scout acts very impulsive and is an obstreperous tomboy but on the other hand she is very clever and more adult than others in her age. Scout always develops the story.",

  "text": "Dear Ali,\n\nHow are things with you? Are you still working all the hours God sends preparing for your exams? I'm sorry I haven't written for ages, but I was very busy with the school project I had to do this month. Thanks again for all your help. I'm very glad I can finally do something for you after everything you've done for me.\nSo you need information about my country's eating customs? Well then, let's start with the time we eat and what we eat at those moments here in Holland. On weekdays, Dutch people take their breakfast, which usually consists of a few sandwiches, somewhere between 7.00 and 8.00 a.m. In the weekend, we tend to sleep in and therefore take our breakfast a bit later. Around 12.00 a.m., most people have lunch, which also consists of sandwiches and is just as light as breakfast. When the clock strikes 6.00 p.m., it's time for dinner, the only warm meal of the day as well as the heaviest meal of the day.\nLet me also tell you something about traditional Dutch meals. The most important ones are probably hotchpotches: mashed potatoes and vegetables, often combined with smoked sausage. In my opinion, some of them are absolutely revolting. A traditional Dutch meal which I think is far more tasty, consists of little thick pancakes, served warm with melted butter and icing sugar. Those pancakes are called \"poffertjes\". They can be eaten any time of the day, for breakfast, lunch, supper... Whole generations are brought up with this dish, yummy as it is.\nIs this enough information for your project?

  "text": "My favourite way to travel is most definitely by plane. \nThere are many reasons why plane travel is the way to go.\n\nFirst, on a plane, I can get to my destination much faster.  This means I can actually go places. \nIn a few hours time, I can get to some far-away destination.  I can make it a quick trip, too.  \nI can go to Paris for a long weekend, for example.  The plane will get me there quickly so that I can have\ngo shopping, eat some lovely French meals, drink lots of wine and return before work on Monday. \n\nBoats trips are long and boring.  I went on an Alaskan cruise in 1997.  It was freezing cold and most of the time we \nwere just sitting on the ship with nothing to do but eat.   I also got sea sick.  I definitely don't recommend it.\nTrains are also boring, unless you take a bullet train, and I get motion sickness. \n\nTherefore, when it comes to speed and being able to go places, planes are definitely the best type of transportation available.   \nI highly recommend a plane trip as soon as possible.",

All of a sudden there was a loud voice that echoed through the neighborhood, and one can almost imagine the silence shattering like a glass. \n                                            People started emerging from their houses, their faces stoned with fear. Not knowing where the sound had come from, they were pulling out smartphones from their robes and jamming their fingers on the screen. Almost all of them were heard shouting in panic \" There has been a terrorist attack in our neighborhood \". But there was only one who knew what and where that explosion had occurred. He was in disbelief, flabbergasted, never expecting that the person living next door would do something so heinous. \n                                          Just a day before Michael was arguing with his friends that Rasheed was a very nice guy. Well educated, open-minded, a liberal at best. So what if he originated from the Arab peninsula, that does not implicate that he is a terrorist. He has been living in the U.K for the past 20 years. \n                                                         But this act was out of question. This was something that could not be argued upon. Not knowing what would be the intellectual thing to do, the first thing that came to his mind was calling the police. After briefing the call respondent about every detail that he had known about Rasheed. He darted towards the backyard, jumped over the hedges. Sprinted towards what seemed like flames, only to find Rasheed standing across it, blood protruding from his right hand. In just a split second the whole incident was explained. What Michael thought to be a terrorist attack was a gas cylinder exploding. First came the confusion and then remorse. Knowing that he had jeopardized his friendship with Rasheed he quietly returned to his house. Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake.\n                                                   ",

Shopping became the way of life for some people, who find it as a hobby as well as pleasant activity. However, it is not always enjoyable. Sufficient to say, buying new items may be viewed as a waste of time. Shopping without purchasing anything tends to be exhausting. There is also a possibility of buying unnecessary items. Often, it turns out, that purchase should not take place at all, the reason being lack of money. Nonetheless, the value of time is as important as money.

The author starts his discussion by discussing his particular passion for the Gothic architecture, and this passion is rather vivid throughout the entire article. In order to explain the nature of the Gothic architecture and its major aspects, the author efficiently employs the musical analogies. \nOne of the major arguments in the article is the comparison between Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music. Bork believes this very comparison to be an efficient one, as it employs the parallels that are easily understandable for a wider audience due to the utilization of simple terms that they can relate to. Furthermore, he finds that there are many similarities between the development of Gothic architecture and Heavy Metal Rock music. For example, the purpose of both is to induce awe and, they both employ the concepts of distortion (Bork 1) . What is more, these styles usually tend to abandon the classical tendencies, and both rose in a response to a new demand in the culture.",

It also cools you down from all the heat left from the summer and into the fall. You have fun with your family making snow angels and have snowball fights. \n             Spring is a good season because it is between winter and summer, temperatures are not too cold and not to hot.

It lets you know that summer is near and so is summer vacation. \n             Summer is great because it’s time to hang up your shoes and relax. There is no more school and you can go to sleep late and wake up late. Relatives visit or you can visit them. You can also do some traveling and explore new places. Relaxing in the pool on a floating lounge chair enjoying cold lemonade is the ultimate experience.\n             Autumn is also a great season because of all the colorful leaves falling even though they are a hassle to pick up, especially in the pools. You can have fun walking with friends and admiring the different shades of colors on the leaves. The different colors warm your soul. \n             Autumn is such a calm season.

It is also important, though, not to underestimate all the educational possibilities that it gives you, as sometimes you can learn more from a documentary than from a school book. \n\nWhat emerged from the discussion we had in class, is that plenty of students spend their free time watching useless reality or TV shows, procrastinating instead of studying for school.\nAs it is a very common phenomenon between teenagers, schools should show them that television also enables you to learn something new. A clear example is that watching television in another language is of vital importance if you aim to learn new vocabularies or improve your comprensive skills, and it makes studying a language really fun and enjoyable.\n\nOn the other hand, it is difficult to focus and pay attention while you are in front of a TV screen. Getting distracted is extremely likely, therefore people watching educational programs may end up switching the TV off or turning over to another channel, as a good movie or any other entertainment is way more appealing.\n\nHad I choose whether considering television educational or not, I would definitely say it is. Nevertheless, we should use it in an appropriate way and be careful about what is the sources of the information told during a tv show, as they might be misleading. \n",

  "text": "Line of Duty, a powerful and gripping drama that gets the nation talking \n\n\nLine of Duty is a British police drama, created by Jed Mercurio, about the investigations of AC-12, a controversial Police Anti-Corruption Unit. A large list of characters appears through the episodes, being the common thread that connects the two seasons the regular ones: Martin Compston (as DS Steve Arnott), Vicky McClure (as DC Kate Fleming) and Adrian Dunbar (as PSupt Ted Hastings).\n\nTherefore, the first chapter features Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott, a high-flying counter-terrorism officer, who is recruited to AC-12 after refusing to collude with his colleagues in the cover-up of a failed operation in which a man was mistaken shot by another cop. He’s one of AC-12’s leading investigators although he sometimes has the tendency to let his personal feelings sways his professional judgement. Fleming plays his partner’s part, an AC-12’s undercover specialist, who prides herself on being the consummate professional, unmoved by emotional considerations. Both of them share superior, Hastings, who remains the ethically upstanding senior investigating officer; zealous and suspicious, not being everyone's cup of tea. Even though being widely recognised for his impeccable ethical standards, he hides a drastic change in his personal circumstances.\n\nTheir scenes are repeatedly stolen, though, by the real stars of the show, the officers who are under suspicion of corruption: Lennie James (DCI Tony Gates) in the first season, and Keeley Hawes (DI Lindsay Denton) in the second one.\n\nWith calculated precision, the plot hatches a story where there are no goodies and baddies, and throws in a few twists and turns that makes your mouth drop —indeed, Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates has adopted a set of particular ethics principles and nevertheless, he’s adored by his loyal team, has got a nice family and has recently been awarded “Officer of the Year”.\n\nTo conclude, those who ultimately felt miserable after the end of the spellbinding second season need not worry;  line of Duty writer Jed Mercurio has been commissioned by the BBC to write third and fourth series and if you haven't tried it before, you've just about got time to catch up.\n",

Usuallly he was energetic, full of confidence, ready to party. But not any more. He was absent-minded all the time, he did not listen to her and when she asked him a question, he just shrugged his shoulders or wrinkled his nose.\nMaybe they could not avoid the seven-year itch. Maybe he had a mistress. But she had no intention to give up. She had fought to hard for this life and she would not let their long-standing relationship to be ruined just like that.\nThey met each other nine years ago. By accident he thought. Accident which had been well prepared by her. She always planned her steps carefully. Her mother was a shy woman who did not know what to do to escape from poverty and even though she had two or three jobs all the time, they did not know if they would have somewhere to sleep the next night. So he was her escape.\nHe was well-off and funny. He was not stupid but you could not expect any perls of wisdom from him. He had never worked but they had been living in a 40-room house with a huge garden and so many servants that she could not remembered their names. They had never worried about money - all bills were paid by his trust found. Who would want to lose this kind of lifestyle?\nSo she decided to ask him straight away.\n\"Are you having a mistress?\",she asked one morning when they were having breakfast.\nHe had not seen that coming and became white as a sheet, raised his eyebrows and just exploded.\n\"How could you even say that? I would never ever do this to you.\"\nAt that moment he was like a bear with soar head. She wanted answers and to have them he needs to be alive not dead of heart attack. So she tried to calm him down. \n\"What is going on than? And do not lie to me! You have always been a very bad liar!\"\nHe held his breath for a second, pursed his lips\n and then words just slipped of his tongue.\n\"We are broken. We do not have any money left. So I have found a job\".\n\"Are you kidding me? You have never worked in your life. What can you possibly do?\"\n\"I am a porter. Every morning I went to the port and unshipped. Nobody there knows me so you should be afraid that some of our friends would recognise me. Nobody will never know that we are poor now\".\nIt was her turn to hold her breath. She was just numb. He was strong as an ox, for sure, but working as a porter? This should be some kind of joke. He was waiting for her response.\nShe had always been level-headed and tried to come up with a plan.\n\"We can  move to smaller house or fired some of the servants?\"\n\"That is impossible! What would our friends say? And where I would put my wine collection? I would rather work as a porter than live in a 20-room house\"\nThey definitely had different idea of poverty. But before clearing that she wanted to ask one more important question:\nWhere, for God's sake, had the money gone?!",

People have to sit next to other people they don't know for a long time, in other words, you may be sitting next to suspicious passengers. Pickpockets are frequent and you might end up being robbed, losing your money, credit cards and personal ID card as well.\nOn the other hand travelling by car allows you to establish your own pace, even when you travel to a place you do not know so well. This means you can set the time you want to leave, because you do not have to respect a specific timebable. Furthermore, you can choose an alternative road, rather than taking a main road. This way you will have the chance to have  more relaxing journey through the countryside, traffic will not be so intense and aggressive, and finally you can plan the time you want to arrive, using a GPS or other technolology to help you plan your journey.\nTo sum up, travelling by public transport can be advantageous when you travel inside a town, but when you have to travel outside your specific territorry, nothing is better than a car.",

I've passed for all this thing. Don't you remember how you cheer me up when things couldn't get any worse?\n\nI think you should take a break. Nothing is worth than getting stressed out about.

They spend all their time thinking only about money, social networks or fashion.\n\nNevertheless, far from arrogance and vanity, we can still find some young people who have interesting personal values that are used by them to define their lifestyle.

The focus on children can be found in the huge contribution the Kids Club has on the daily life in the hotel. You can find Kids Club's Members everywhere in the hotel, except for your room. The hotel handles privacy very well and I can guess most of the guests will appreciate it.\n\nHowever, walking distances in the hotel are way too far for families with young children. You find yourself walking five hundred meters to the swimming pool. That doesn't seem too far, but when you have small children, you could be walking this twelve times a day. A quick trip to the toilet changes into a 1 kilometer hike, which is not pleasant when you have small children.\n\nIn conclusion, the Miracle Resort is a very beautiful and appealing place to go. There are plenty of things to do, and the ambiance in the hotel is relaxed, so you can really enjoy your holiday. A more compact building would be more appreciated by most of the people.",

This TV series is presented by Netflix, an online service that allows its subscribers to view any TV Show, anywhere, and in any device. The first difference when compared to ordinary TV Shows is that all episodes from Season One were released at the same time. This seems like a small thing but it represents a major change in the way people view TV shows. By releasing all episodes at once, each user can watch each chapter at their own rate and speed, devouring them all in an afternoon or only one per week.\nThe series provides an unorthodox view into the lives of eight people that are connected by some sort of magical spirit. This connection allows them to see through each other eyes, and even control each other movements. In order to make the series more interesting, the directors decided that each of the eight chosen ones would be in a different country. This decision made the series extraordinary, with scenes recorded in Seoul, Nairobi, San Francisco, Mumbai, London, Berlin, Mexico and Chicago. The series provides an amazing window into eight different, and extraordinary worlds, with beautiful landscapes.\nTo sum up, I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in science-fiction, but also to anyone curious about different cultures as \"Sense8\" provides an unseen view into the lives of eight very different characters, their surroundings, religion, and traditions.",

  "text": "Hi Juliana,\n\n\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nTo be honest, in the questionnaire you send, I could give a positive response to the most of the questions but I don't consider myself a code expert. I couldn't answer, in particular, the questions about PHP and MySQL.\n\nIn JavaScript I have some experience but not in the necessary quality that is required for such a position, I think.\n\nLike I told you, I'm a web graphic designer, among other, focused more in design and my usage of code is very limited. If I have to, I search the web for information and implement it but it requieres time.\n\nPerhaps is there some chance of acquiring knowledge during the development of the activity.\n\nAbout my CV you have, it is up to date and you can keep it, maybe you have some new offer that patches better with my profile. I am very interested in multilingual jobs, with German, Spanish, English and Italian, related to marketing, IT web-analytics, Customer service...\n\nDon't hesitate to contact me if you have some offer that you think could fit with my background. I'm always open to new interesting suggestions.\n\nHave a beautiful day.\n\nRamón Verdugo",

  "text": "A Love Affair with Baking\n\nWhat is it about cooking shows? Why is it that whenever Ina Garten, Ana Olson or Nigella Dawson is on, I tend to stop everything that I'm doing and just get fixated on the TV? The Food Network has become my favourite channel I can tune to it the whole day! It's so relaxing and very informative, I never get bored.\n\nCooking shows are fun to watch, but my most favourite shows are those about cakes and pastries. I really enjoy baking that I often buy books about it.\n\nCheesecake for me is the simplest yet most sophisticated cake there is. To make one, just whisk some eggs and sugar, add some milk and a few drops of vanilla and then pour onto a greased cake pan and bake. After a couple of minutes, take the cake out of the oven and let it cool down. It's best served when chilled, so better wait for a few more minutes before diving into it. To decorate the cake, whip some cream and top with fresh fruit.\n",

  "text": "Introduction\nThe purpose of this report is to outline some aspects of my experience, such as, with whom I stayed, where I spent the week and what places I visited. I will also make reference to some suggestions that might help to improve the exchange programme.\nParticularities of the exchange\nRecently, I spent a week in Switzerland as a part of a students exchange programme. I stayed with a local family, which happens to be the family of the person that stayed with me when he took part in the same programme. His name is John, and like me he is getting a degree in Phisics Engeneering in the hope that someday he can work at a research center, such as CERNE, convinientely placed a few miles away from his house. \nI strongly recommend that the programme organisers should make interest free loans, available to people wishing to participate in an exchange. This would allow considerable numbers of talented students to benefit from an opportunity which they would otherwise be unable to take. ",

  "text": "Before addressing the question of what is better for young people, I would like to remind that both activities (spending time on a computer and watching television) are harmful for children's/teen's health. \n\nAt the other side it's impossible to imagine our life without computers and television.\n\nWith the help of computers young people can meet new friends, find out a lot of information,take part in forums and discussions. Surfing the Internet needs imagination, logical thinking and knowledge. Young people are able to choose what they want to watch/read/listen to, and the choice is practically unlimited.\n\nTelevision can't give such an opportunity.\n\nPrecisely here is found the crux of the problem. There are plenty of free sites with content far from morality; many computer games impose cruelty. And the idea that, spending time in Internet's chats young people develop their social skills, is problematic. I wish it would be so! But getting used to the Internet's rules of comunication, they might find it difficult to face up to reality, make friends in the real world.\n\nFor my part, I spend a lot of time on my computer (learning English and working). But when I want to relax I'd rather watch TV with my friends than loiter away time sitting alone in front of the computer!",

  "text": "This restaurant is recommended to me by my aunt who was working just around the corner of this restaurant a few years ago. This restaurant specializes in southeast Asian cuisine and it is called The Chai.\n\nPersonally, what I love about this restaurant is the ambiance. It has a unique modern-rustic interior design suitable for any occasion be it a birthday party, family gathering or even a date with your loved ones. Besides that, this restaurant is located in the heart of one of the most popular cities in southeast Asia, Kuala Lumpur. I was blown away by the breathtaking view of the city from my window. From my experience, I feel that the food served in this restaurant is of fine quality not to mention how delicious the food is. Not only that, I was lost for choices as I flipped the menu as there was a huge variety of southeast Asian food that ranges from Thai food, Indonesian food, Chinese food and the list goes on. The food on the menu was amazingly not for illustration purposes only as the food they served looked exactly like the ones in the menu. \n\nIn my opinion, I think this is the most suitable restaurant for this special occasion as everyone would have a wide variety of food to choose from and just let the view of the city enhance the night.

  "text": "So as the end of term is getting closer and closer, many students are being stressed out and it is certainly not different for me. But if you know how to deal with your nervousity during exam period, you can take the success of passing exams for granted. \nFirstly, create your timetable. That is one of the most secure ways to make sure, you will manage things on time without getting any redundant stress. Place it in the most visible and strategical point in your room and stick up to it.\nSpeaking of mental and physical health, you should definitely get enough sleep. Without a mind and body regeneration, you will not be able to learn as fast and as effectively as you would after a good rest.\nTo kick off your day, give your body enough energy, in the form of proteins. Also, to activate your brain quicker, go out for a fresh air. The more oxygen you get for your organism, the easier you will be able to concentrate on anything you do.\nLast but not least, the exam itself is the toughest nut to crack. Focus and go through the given tasks slowly and keep calm. Mark and leave the most difficult ones in the end. This method will keep your state of mind assertive and clear. Good luck with the upcoming exams!",

The telephone was convenience, something used to help people communicate, to make their lives easier. Internet changed people's routine. Today, the Internet is one of the most effective and efficient ways to communicate. Telephones changed, technology became smarter and allows people to stay connected everywhere they go. Although the large number of advantages that Internet and phones give to us, the use of technology affect people's ability to communicate face to face. We communicate through our accounts, emails or chats. We just take  turns talking (chatting is maybe more correct to say) and most of the times without any aim. Using messages people forget to use grammar or even make full sentances. But that's not the biggest problem. The worst thing is that people don't know how to talk to each other, how to make conversation with new people or even though old friends. Emoticons replace emotions, chats replace calls, usernames replace people. Nowadays communication face to face is something rare and most of the times accident. People just take turns talking without putting any purpose or feelings.",

There is also a building which can be considered as an interacive museum. \nIn a very interesting way you can find somehing about the history of Siemianowice and about mines. There is a lot of old photos compared with new ones. \nYou can see how places used to look and how they look today. What impress me the most is a combination of old elements of the building with glass and bricks. In that building you can find also a small cinema. There is also a cafe which serves traditional Silesian cuisine. During summer park organizes many exhibitions and cultural events.

It’s a team gameplay where you have to start and stop like in aerobics. It burns lots of calories, build endurance and build up muscles. 80% of the game is mental, you have to think what move you should do next what the rest of the team is up to. As well as being a great way to stay fit basketball can help you to make new friends and make you a good team player. That’s why basketball is my favourite sport and it should be yours too!\n    If you are thinking that you should do some sports, you would really enjoy playing basketball. If you don’t really enjoy playing in a team, don’t worry! Basketball can be played and enjoyed with as a few as two people even if the official games of basketball require 10 people. The beauty of this sport is that as long as you got a ball you can spend hours dribbling or shooting on your own.\n      I think that you should start practicing this sport because it helps you physically and mentally and it is a good way to socialize.\n",

  "text": "Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake. That was it. It really was over between him and Marianne. After years of contemplating between staying with Marianne - who was more or less the joy of his parents' life, not him, Marianne - for life or leaving and start fresh, he has finally chosen the latter, thinking that it was the right decision to make at that moment. But now, every second that passed after that monumental moment just made him feel worse and worse about himself, making second thoughts about whether he should have stayed with Marianne or not. He sighed as he sat down on the big empty couch and remembered all the memories he had with Marianne. Both good and bad.\n\nTheir first date was more or less awkward, which was typical for most first dates in life. He had taken her out to a five-star restaurant, to which she insisted that it was too much, which got Michael to insist that it was okay. But all awkwardness aside, it ended with a first kiss. A tidal wave of feelings sparked inside Michael's head as he moved his lips along with Marianne's.\n\nA few weeks later saw the occurrence of their first fight. Michael had an unexpected late meeting at work that night and forgot to call home, which made Marianne completely furious; throwing things to the wall, crashing plates from the counter to the ground, the whole nine yards. After Michael barely calmed Marianne down, they had a mature heart-to-heart, one someone would say was way too late, but at that moment, it felt right.\n\nHis mind then thought of their last kiss. Man, when was that? It had to be about a fortnight ago, before he went to Sochi for a business meeting. It was merely a goodbye kiss, a quick brush of lips before he had to rush to the airport. A week later, he found that Marianne was cheating on him with a European businessman he didn't have the mind to remember the name of. It was the unofficial end of the relationship, the decision before the actual talk. But at that moment, it ended.\n\nBut, in life, you can't hold onto the past. You have to keep moving forward. You have to carry on. And one day, you'll find the true love that you'll trust, the one that'll catch you when you fall, console you when you cry. You just have to keep looking.",

  "text": "I’m going to talk about doctor who, a British sci-fi TV show about an alien called the Doctor who travels through time and space in a police box called the TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space). The first episode aired in 1963 and since then Doctor Who has been one of the most famous sci-fi TV shows on television. Actually, last year was its 50th anniversary and to celebrate it a special episode in 3D was broadcast. \nSince the TV show aired the character of the Doctor has been played by 12 actors, the newest one was announced on summer last year, which is when I was visiting London with my family. It really caught my attention how relevant Doctor Who is in the UK because almost every time I turned on the TV there was someone talking about who could be the new Doctor, it appeared in the news, in newspapers and the day the BBC was going to reveal the name of the actor they even made a special show about it. However, I really liked experiencing that because I had never seen the media in Spain pay so much attention to a TV show.  Since I was in London, I thought it could visit The Who Shop, it is a shop dedicated to Doctor Who and it has a museum with costumes and other things that have appeared in the TV show. We didn’t have much time to go there because it was far from our hotel so I had to go only with my father while the rest of my family was somewhere else. If we had stayed more time we would have been able to spend more time at the shop but anyway, I loved going there and meeting other people who also liked Doctor Who and I bought some merchandise from the shop.\nWhen the BBC finally announced who was going to play as the 12th Doctor, many fans got upset about their choice because they thought the new actor was too old and they said they didn’t like it. But hopefully not everyone was like that. When an important TV show goes through such a big change not everybody likes it, that is why the same thing happened when the BBC announced who would be playing as the 11th Doctor. Nobody liked him at first but now that he is leaving everybody loves him and wants him to stay. Actually, I’m one of those fans who are sad about the 11th Doctor leaving because he is my favourite one, as he was the one I experienced Doctor Who with because I started watching the TV show when he was playing the main role. \nAnyway, before the BBC had announced who was going to play the Doctor’s role, the fans had started making suppositions about who could act as him. Some said that he would be played by others famous British actors but others thought that an actress should play the new role.\nI found out about Doctor Who because a friend of mine saw people talking about it online and she told me about it. When I started watching it I thought it was a bit weird but I ended up really liking it. Thanks to it I have met a lot of people who share the same interests as I do and I have discovered some of my favourites TV shows. I like Doctor Who because time travel has always caught my attention, also I like it because the plot is incredible, something that happened on season one can be connected with some of the last episodes.\n",

And when they had nothing to quench their thirst and hunger with, she used to invent imaginary worlds where they are wealthy and don't have a thought in the world.\nThe note was almost illegible but Alison knew. She has been waiting for that moment all her life.\nI'm ok. The note read and her tears rolled down her pale face.\n\nAt least we are not alone, she said and hugged her brother.\nI'm ok.

  "text": "Have you ever travelled by plane? Have you or someone you know been to another country, on another continent? Most if not all of inhabitants of this planet would answer ‘yes’. Last century provided us countless opportunities to be more mobile. We, humans, can say that we live on the planet Earth without being metaphorical first time in all our history. There are still borders, both on maps and in minds for us to overcome, but the situation has changed drastically in a century or less. \nThe world of the first half of the XIX century was quite different from that. Of course, most of westerners already were able to imagine the Globe with relative accuracy, but the picture in their minds differed from the one in ours. It rather had the same shades with medieval maps that pictured dragons guarding earthen paradise somewhere near the shore of Indias. By ‘shades’ I mean not real colors, but those undertones that our mind imparts to everything it comes in touch with. China and India were almost of the same accessibility for the ordinary carpenter from Edinburgh as they were for his predecessor five centuries ago.\n",

  "text": "‘Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.’ – Nelson Mandela I believe that education is important and it is able to bring about enormous changes to an individual. Since I was a kid, I have started to think of being a teacher. That’s why I have always been making an effort to enhance my knowledge and experiences for being a teacher in my future pathway.\n\nSince I was in F.5, when I became capable to teach somebody, I started to be a Korean teacher and a private English tutor. From these experiences, I discovered that teaching people will never be an effortless job. As a teacher, I have to be considerate, unbiased, trustworthy and decisive. I have to try my best to take care of all students and to ensure that the contents are accessible for them. Apart from that, it has been a good practice for speaking. As a teacher, I have to talk in front of many students and that fostered me to become a better speaker. I have gained a lot from these experiences.\n\nAs to enhance my knowledge, I tried to grab chance to bring up my English level. In 2014, I had completed the ‘Let’s Debate’ writing program offered by The Standard and written a total of 4 articles for the ‘Let’s Debate’ column of The Standard Student and Junior Standard. It had been a truly valuable program for me and it brushed up on my English. Moreover, I had also participated in the Standard Chartered Hong Kong English Public Speaking Contest on 2015. Although I was not able to attain any awards in the competition, I gained a lot of public speaking skills from the competition. These experiences were tremendously memorable to me and it was my honor to take part in these events.\n\nApart from that, as I believe that languages are the basic channel of communications between people, I have studied several foreign languages to equip myself. Starting from F3, I learnt Korean and I attained level 5 in TOPIK (Test of Proficiency in Korean). I have also been preparing for the level 6 test since then. Other than Korean, I have also been learning Japanese and Spanish starting from F5. Learning languages is indeed difficult and painstaking. However, I enjoy my journey in learning them. Not only can foreign languages become a huge advantage to me, it can also bring me satisfaction and gratification. That’s why I love learning foreign languages.\n\nIt is my aspiration to devote my time to the study of English and education. I would also like to further my studies of various foreign languages in the university. It has been my life goal to become an English teacher in order for me to make contributions to our society. Therefore, I have always been willing to be offered the chance to take and English and education related program in my tertiary education so as to fulfill my dream and to accomplish my life goal. I hope that I can be one of the candidates you find suitable for your university.\n",

  "text": "Dear Sir or Madam, \n\nI am writing in reply to the article about the usage of mobile phones at high school which was published in your newspaper on Monday 12th of September.  I would totally agree with the idea that children should not use mobile phones during class, but during breaks.\n\nIn the first place, it seems to me that it is really important, both for children and parents to communicate in order to organize their lives taking into account the changing schedules. However, it is also remarkable that there are proper times to talk on the phone, and proper times to learn. Of course, we all have the right to communicate whenever we want but, mostly, whenever we need. Using the phone during breaks let the students focus on the lesson and then, have a bit of distraction when they are not there and, what is more, keep parents relaxed because they can communicate with their children and talk about what they need. That is why I totally agree with Richardson’s modality dealing with this important issue which is present in students, schools and parents lives nowadays. \n\nSecondly, I would like to mention that I agree with the experiment that is taking place in some districts about permitting students use their mobile phones for educational purposes, and what is more, with Richardson’s facing this issue. Technology is one of the most important parts of our lives, so we should incorporate it to our habits. Of course, when we are talking about children and education, it may seem a bit complicated since this subject has both advantages and disadvantages.  For instance, it is really motivating for students to use technology in the classrooms. However, teachers run the risk of losing their responsibility there, and students can lose their educational way looking at the phones as a way of entertainment instead of as a way to make education enjoyable and effective, as you say in one of your paragraphs: “The Richardson decision is a sound alternative to students secretively using their phones under their desk” .  \n\nI consider that something should be done in order to balance pros and cons of having mobile phones present at schools because, firstly, students are the ones who must be present and, what is more, their learning process also must be there.  As I said, it is really important that parents can communicate with their children because they are taking care of them and they are their parents, so they have the right to communicate with them whenever they need. Apart from that, I strongly believe that technology can be incorporated in the classroom, but teachers and schools are the ones who have to control this activity so that it can be positive both for students and teachers in order to make the learning process more motivating and effective. \n\nAll in all, I think that schools should not stop taking into account this important subject. Technology and, mostly, mobile phones are part of children and parents lives, so schools don’t have to ban it, but look for alternatives in order that they don’t make a negative effect in education. Richardson’s methodology is fantastic and I think that there are more, and it is important that we know them in order to be informed about this important issue. \n\nI look forward to reading more articles about this subject. \n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMagali Hervieux. \n",

  "text": "This report aims to present different advertising strategies for our products according to the type of customers we have. In addition, I will recommend the best kind of advertising for our needs.\n\nFirst, to have a successful campaign it is important to know the target market. A survey about the kind of customers for our product revealed that most of them are young adults. This means that they are between 20 and 30 years old.\n\nAfter studying our advertising options, it was found that two of them can be suitable for our purpose. One way is to put advertising on the internet and use social networks. On the other hand, we can set up stands in shopping malls. In order to obtain maximum benefit from this it will be helpful if we give away product samples.\n\nAs I mentioned above, advertising campaign must be appropriate to the target market. I therefore feel justified in recommending that the campaign in shopping malls will be more effective for us. This is mainly because besides being cheaper customers will become familiar with the product.\n\nIn conclusion, we have different options for this campaign. If we choose the appropriate kind of advertising for our product I can assure you that we will succeed.",

  "text": "With the rise in time, the entire world has become one concrete jungle. The human race began from the jungle where he lived amidst the worries and fears of wild beasts and under the illusionary protection of tall trees and now the journey of human race has come to the same scenario where once again, he is living amidst the fears of wild beasts called 'other humans' and under the 'illusionary protection' of stalwart buildings that may either collapse due to an earthquake or a terrorist-attack.\n\nThis is the world of globalisation where the entire world is one market. Every person is marketing himself; is selling himself; is presenting himself as a decorated gift-item.\nThis is why, although we have the luxury of extravagant knowledge under our feet because of internet, we encounter complications and complexities in the decoding of our relationships and in deciphering this perennial flow of knowledge.\nI, for that reason, certainly agree with the statement of the given issue. With knowledge and information, things become comprehensible but more complex.\n\nThe religion of Scientology is known as one of the fastest growing religions of the world. It, today, has millions of followers who believe in its philosophy that reincarnation is the truth and a human feels tied-up because of the constant pull of the strings of his past lives. Interestingly, Scientology practitioners use technology to prove their hypothetical statements, for they have constructed machines that exhibit the working of brains through waves and softwares that question a practitioner and provide him with a solution to his worries.\n\nIn contrast to this, the religions that have survived since the earlier times had discreet knowledge, however they had a much deeper impact. They were simple yet profound, relying on the comprehensible philosophies of forgiveness and karma.\nScientology proves how the acquisition of widespread knowledge hasn't stopped the birth of new religions, however, ironically, it has made the philosophies of life more dramatic with the mysterious complexities of technology.\n\nLikewise, there are many conspiracy theorists in the world who time and again circulate rumours regarding the existence of a secret organisation (illuminati, for instance) that runs the world secretly and plots for all the pre-timed wars and terrorist-attacks. The theorists ascertain that the organisation is part religious and part political; it rules over the international media, thereby being omnipotent. Furthermore, they concoct stories and concepts, publicise them while making animated versions all over the internet.\nThe brilliance of their presentations is so acute that an ordinary man is almost forced to feel enlightened in his ignorance, finally becoming brainwashed.\nThe same technique is used by politicians, iconoclasts and leaders who pollute the minds of the people through the medium of technology. They present complex informations so smartly that an ignorant fool feels like a sagacious monk, whence he becomes the follower and a voter.\n\nThus, by all means, today we have an easy accessibility to knowledge and we have a wide range of resources to allocate and obtain endless information.\nNevertheless, there is a stomach-wrenching mystery and indecipherable codes around that sometimes makes a common man wonder about his vulnerable existence and unknowingly being-exploited life.",

  "text": "I choose option A: I think it is a good idea for children to travel on public transit. There are several reasons why I support this choice. First, it is unnecessary to spend more money on school buses because by Grade 5 children are able to take care of themselves and each other. They can communicate well and are aware of dangerous situations. For example, if they see drunk or dirty people on public buses, they could avoid sitting near them or report them to the bus driver. Second, it is a good opportunity to educate them in life skills such as knowing not to sit in priority seats or leave litter on the bus. \n\nIn contrast, I think that the parents who insist their children should only travel on school buses protect them too much. In daily life, many youngsters need to go to school and back by public transportation. In other words, if parents spoil their offspring then they may become too dependent and incapable of functioning well in society later on.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not only a good chance to take the children on an adventure, but also help them become independent young adults. I think this way can assist them in adapting to society early.",

  "text": "To: Peter Jackson\nFrom: Branislava Sidorov\nDate: 25th May 2014.\nSubject: End-of-year party\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to compare the two proposed venues River Boat Disco and Milford Comedy Club and to recommend one based on the survey carried out among the students.\n\nEntertainment and food\nNot only does River Boat Disco has its own experienced DJ, but it also has a buffet which is more then appropriate for this occasion. Although Milford Comedy Club offers a fun night with four established comedians, the only food available is snacks. However the main disadvantage of the disco is that it ends very early at 10:30 pm, whereas the comedy club is open until 2 am.\n\nPrice\nThe pricing for the disco is very reasonable because it offers the venue, entertainment and food for $25. Even though the price is $5 smaller for comedy club, it is without food and by the end of the night I do not think there would be much difference.\n\nLocation\nThe boat is located at the Crofton Harbour and some means of transport would be necessary to get there. It would be possible to organize a bus, which would be preferable to going separately by car. However the comedy club is easy to find and is accessible by metro and taxi.\n\nRecommendation\nI would suggest the River Boat Disco because not only does it offer a buffet, but also the people are more likely to converse with each other while listening to music than to a comedian.",

  "text": "\"Manjiare Di Roma\" - An Italian Restaurant\n\nThis Italian restaurant is in Monção and near the school. It was opened about four years ago by two friends who had previously worked at pizza places.\nAs you enter the restaurant you are met with the traditional Italian restaurant red towels and a bit of a rustic feel, behind the counter you can see the cooks making the pizzas.\nThere is a great variety of dishes, from starters to main dishes and desserts, my recommendation is garlic bread as a starter. As a main dish you can choose anything from pasta to pizza of all kinds (even chocolate).\nThis restaurant is very affordable, the prices are extremely reasonable, especially if you're a student, because there's a special menu called \"student's menu\" where you choose two ingredients for you pizza with or without French fries and a drink for about three euros.\nEveryone in the staff is extremely nice and very often the owners come to make small talk with the clients.\nAll in all, I think this woould be the best restaurant for our class to go, since it's close to the school, it has good prices and a friendly ambience. Also everyone enjoys Italian food, so everyone would be pleased.",

  "text": "  Dreaming about future is like creating an imaginary world, perfect for yourself and the others. If present doesn't satisfy you, let's take a trip in the future. I'm sure you will enjoy the ride!\n  Year 2064. People are living their lives in a way that we would consider it more than shocking. Everyone is leaving their perfectly \"normal\" lives in the sky. You've read it well. Their houses are floating in the air. It is amazing. Because of the lack of space, people had come with a brilliant idea of creating these floating houses, they are made of a special type of glass and have a spherical shape. By finding this solution, they have more space to work on earth and they even protect the environment. Not to mention the huge advantage that people are protected from earthquakes because these houses do not have direct contact with the earth. This idea is more than brilliant!\n  When it comes to their jobs, people work on earth, like oldtimes. The way they go to work is worth knowing. They have cars, not like the cars people from 2014 were used to, but they still call them this way. These cars can go down to their destination and then, go up again until the driver pushes a button. This button is called \"find me and come to me\". The name says it all. Once the button is pushed the car finds the driver and literally picks him up. \n  The streets look all new and improved. Lots of the buildings are skyscrapers and the architecture has completely changed. People are still human beings and act completely normal. They seem happy with the way they live and embrace the change in everything.\n  overall, this is an image of the future. Now let's return to the present because we have a lot of work to do if we want to live in that kind of future eventually.       ",

You can also spend that time working and saving money for future years on university camp. It is the only time in your life to do that, to be honest. After you finish studying, you will have to immediately start working unless you want to live with your parents for the rest of your life. But the year right after you finish high school is a perfect time to find yourself, to decide what you want to do with your life. You can go on a road trip around your country or travel somewhere very distant and learn things you've never heard about on your own skin. It could also be potentially your last chance to spend so much time with your high school friends. You will definitely part your ways during college and this way you can make memories that will last for a lifetime. I think everyone should take a year off after leaving school.

CLIL implementation is always a challenge for the teacher, but it seems to be even more difficult when talking about subjects as Arts and Crafts which are more based on the acquisition of skills and the development of another language, the artistic. How to provide student with more real and relevant input, in the daily routine of an art class, seems to be a dare for Arts and Crafts teachers, who need to bring together the development of the artistic language and the learning of a foreign language. \n\nDespite the difficulties that CLIL teachers have to overcome, the truth is that the atmosphere of CLIL lessons is in some way special. What surprised me more positively was the level of peer support, the cooperation and the comradeship. It is interesting to see how the students resort each other looking for help in a natural way, without the intervention of the teacher. Peer support is something that teachers expect and promote in all subjects, but it seems to emerge more genuinely when talking about CLIL atmosphere.\n",

  "text": "Many people have the impression that learning a language is only possible through hard work: studying grammar rules, learning vocabulary by heart and burying your head in a book. However, there are in fact several methods that you can employ should you want to become a linguist. In this essay I will discuss two of these: the immersion method, and the classroom method.\n\nFirstly, the immersion method takes its inspiration from the way in which we all learnt to speak our nature tongue: implicitly. With this method, learners are simply exposed to the target language, either by going abroad to live in the country where it is spoken, or by having a native teacher. There is no explicit focus on grammar; instead, the learners are expected to “absorb” the language and its rules. This method has its advantages, as it is the way we all learnt to speak, and so it is arguably more natural. Another advantage is that students are unencumbered by overcomplicated, confusing metalanguage.\n\nSecondly, the classroom method is the one with which most students (especially if they are older) are familiar. Learners are normally taught in their mother tongue, and are given grammar rules, which they then apply to the language they are learning. This method also has its benefits, not least logistically speaking, since many students don’t have access to native speakers or are not able to travel abroad. Furthermore, some learners respond better to an explicit focus on rules, which make them aware of the mistakes they are making.\n\nWhile both methods clearly have their advantages, I believe that just limiting students to either one or the other can have a negative effect on language learning. Having a native speaker will give students maximum exposure to the language, while at the same time a focus on rules will give them the tools for self-correction and self-study.  I fully believe that this combination method is the most effective way for students to learn English.\n",

  "text": "Now we are going to evaluate the main charactheristics and differences between a pellet stove and a pellet boiler.\nLet's start to focus our attention at the pellet stove. The diagram shows a compact structure and the simplicity of the machine; it has three main sections: the feed section, the combustion chamber and the blower(i.e. fan). In the first conic part it is possible to feed with the fuel (i.e. the pellet) that leads to the combustion chamber where the pellet will burn to generate the heat necessary to warm up the air. Beneath the combustion chamber there is the ash tray necessary to collect the ash generated by the combustion of the pellet. As mantion above the heat is necessary to warm up the air that, thanks to the fan, will be blown out to the room in order to warm up the external ambient (e.g. room, bathroom, kitchen...). This is a pretty compact machine but it's not very efficient and very clean. Actually, it produces a high amount of pollution such as ash and exhausted gas that contains micro- and nano-particle.\nLet's focus now on the pellet boiler. The structure is pretty much the same as the pellet stove, the difference is that instead of a fan here we have a pump due to the fact that the goal of the boiler is to warm up water and send it to the heaters all over the house, so it's nedded a pump to do that instead of just a fan (the pourpose of a fan and a pump it's the same: move fluid from a point A to a pont B, but in one case you have to move air and in the second case water (they have a different density: water has 1000 times the density of air).\nLike in the stove there is a feed section where you can feed the pellet that will go directly to the combustion chamber (according to the control system) in order to burn it and generate the heat to warm up the water. Now, thanks to the pump the hot water is able to reach the upstairs rooms.\nBasically the two rely on the same methods: burning pellets to warm up a fluid (air for the stove and water for the boiler).\n",

There might appear a few situations, when shopping instead of joy can bring a headache. \n\nFirst of all, it is quite hard to enjoy shopping when you are forced to do it. The best example here could be the regular, every-week filling-the-fridge shopping, which in principle cannot be pleasant. Personally I am not able to find anything exciting in hanging around extremely high supermarket shelves and pushing heavy trolley.  Crowd in every corner, awful and unpleasant lights and the necessity to run from one end of the market to another, because these shops are organised in the way, which forces you to see everything, in order to find what you really need.  That and the extremely long queues for the cash desk also are not very encouraging. \n\nWhat is more I hate do shopping when I really need to buy something. Because there is this wicked, unwritten rule, according to which if you are looking for something, there is not the slightest chance you will get it.  You will not be able to find the right size, the right colour or simply anything which would suit your taste. \nShopping with your husband, boyfriend, father or any representative of the male kind, also can totally ruin the most fruitful shopping ever. I believe they are genetically programmed to take away all your ‘joie de vivre’.  The constant grumbling, regular checking the time, this anxious and adrift facial expression – how on earth it could create a favourable conditions for shopping?!  And believe me there is no difference if you are shopping for yourself or for them, it always looks this way. \n\nIn conclusion, shopping can be and usually is a great opportunity, not only to expand contents of your wardrobe, but also, to relax and spend a great time. You just have to avoid supermarkets, buy clothes in advance – so there will not appear the situation, when you need something really badly and it is not in your closet, and of course of  the male company, better choose the female companion.\n",

I love dancing and I do ballet, which requires a lot of discipline. \n\nI started dancing when I was six years old, my mates and I were so cute with our little dresses and tiny feet doing slow movements. For me it wasn't funny at all so I always tried to skip my classes, and I finally didn't go back the following year. \n\nBut seven years later, as a teenager, I found ballet really feminine and I decided to start again. I think that this is not a usual sport, but it has the same advantages: it burn calories, improve circulation, is good for the bones and muscles... Therefore is a really beautiful way to exercise and help you to improve flexibility. \n\nMy advice for people who would like to start dancing ballet is: don't be afraid, it doesn't matter if you are seven or seventy, if you want to do it you can.

From the early nomad tribes, to the first human settlements, then to villages and cities to the formation of civilization, man has never stood still for too long. Key discoveries have changed the course of history. First, the fire, then agriculture, irrigation, and nowadays with technology. The more knowledge we accumulate, the faster progress will come. Mankind went from a rural based society to a modern skyscraper-filled civilization in just a century. And we will continue this process for as long we exist.\n\nThe discovery of electricity has increased our productivity greatly. Instead of just working during the day, man now could continue working during the night. Factories could have long working hours in order to produce more. People in turn started to consume more due to the increased workforce and the greater offer of products. The quick and practical life in the city started to drive thousands of people away from the fields. \n\nWith the advance of electronic products, information has become even easier to spread. First with the radio, news about events happening far from your local community could be easily heard by anyone within earshot. Then with TVs, information started to spread faster and faster until our contenporary instantaneous reports from across the world in the palm of our hands.\n\nSometimes it seems we have reached the pinacle of existence. I'm sure the pharaos of Egypt felt that way when they gazed at the Pyramids. And yet, we've come this far.

  "text": "Education and technology are deeply related, to a certain extent in that education has suffered a series of changes throughout the past 20 years. In present times it is very common to see people learning courses through a computer. Online learning has become a modern phenomena in order to gain knowledge; however, face-to-face learning is still the better learning option chosen by students. Although there are many differences among these two, similarities can be found as well.\n\nThe main similarity between face-to-face learning and online learning is that they both provide valuable learning skills to students. Currently, exist all types of courses via the Internet, at any academic or vocational level. For instance, degree courses, master courses or just an updating course can be found. Adding to this, both learning options require time and dedication from students; otherwise, knowledge will not be properly delivered.\n\nOn the other hand, differences between face-to-face learning and virtual learning are numerous. Firstly, online learning conveys flexibility in its shedule. Studentd can attend courses when they decide, but always respecting due dates. Another difference between face-to-face learning and online learning may be that face-to-face learning allows students to develop human-relationships, whereas online learning is quite impossible on this to happen. During face-to-face learning students have a teacher-student relationship, as well as a peer-to-peer relationship, allowing them to develop inter-personaal skills and coexistence. Last but not least, time spent on these courses are different too. When doing a fece-to-face course besides having an attendance schedule, people spend more time commuting to the place where the course is given. In current days, traffic jams are a fact in big cities; therefore a lot of time is lost commuting.\n\nConsequentlu, both learning options have their positive and negative aspects. Assessing these similarities and differences each student has the option to choose the option which better suits in his lifestyle.",

With Germany and Austria being our neighbours and thus business partners to many Czech companies, German is the second most popular foreign language spoken, followed by Russian, French, Italian and Spanish.\n\nWho learns languages in my country\nMostly, it is children at schools who learn languages. They start learning English or German at the age of eight. Other language of their choice follows at secondary school. However, there might be a problem with the choice as not every secondary school offers e.g. Spanish or Italian, so students have to choose a language they do not prefer. Students at some schools also have a possibility of exchange programmes but these can be quite expensive and not every family can afford such an event. There are also many adults who want to learn or just improve their language skills. Adults usually attend language courses, or use a variety of on-line courses.\n\nRecommended changes\nI would recommend the government to increase salaries for Spanish, Italian or French teachers to persuade them to teach at schools instead of giving private lessons. It would also be wise to donate schools that prepare exchange programs for their students, so that more of them could afford that.\n",

However, young people generally don't pay enough attention to their health and fitness. \n\nThere are many young people who follow Hollywood stars or famous singers and want to have the same bodies as them. As a consequence, they become slim and they don't ingest enough proteins and vitamins to have a healthy life\n\nOn the other hand, teenagers are becoming more dependent on cellphones, video games and television which make them being more sedentary. Being always on the bed or on the sofa is not recommended, whereas going outside and run or ride a bicycle would be a better option. This way they would be doing physical exercise. \n\nFinally, to be healthy it is also important to eat balanced food. Snacks, fast food, fried food and sweets are part of young people's life as they can find them everywhere: in the shops on the street, at parties and in shopping malls.\n\nIn conclusion, young people should behave differently towards their health and fitness. Being sedentary and eating fast food will not bring them anywhere.\n",

  "text": "The statement is rather too categorical, because to say that there is no future is going too far. It is true though, that  public transport would not be the general public's first choice. Sometimes the reasons for doing so are not to do with convenience but, rather more to do with economic issues or matters of conscience.\n\nIf we think selfishly, then the car is the obvious choice. It is easy, fast and ,we can almost park it right outside our destination or at walking distance -shorter rather than longer. It is initially expensive but it is so handy that we end up thinking it is part of us and  even think we cannot live without it.\n\nRaising people's awareness of  pollution and how we must have a more sustainable existence is what makes us look for other less selfish and handy options. Publis transport is always going to be slower, less flexible and much less convenient but we have the reassurance that we are doing what is best for our planet. We are complying to the norm.\n\nIn conclusion, public transport  will always have a future if local governments have policies to promote it. It is never the attractive option, but it is the one which shows more solidarity.",

  "text": "Government jobs carry with them serious responsibilities. It is therefore no surprise that a person’s age and experience come under scrutiny when positions in government need to be filled. Many feel influential government jobs should be reserved for those who are older and have more experience, while others feel the criterion for these positions should be capability, namely whomever is most able to carry out the job. This essay will look at both sides before drawing a logical conclusion.\nOn the one hand, many argue that younger people should be made ineligible for important government positions, and the implications of this opinion are clear. Those operating at senior levels within a country’s military, for example, require field experience to prevent disastrous decisions that could cause the needless loss of life. Were younger people allowed to fast track their ascension within a country’s military, they could find themselves having to make critical choices based more on theoretical study than practical experience, and this could have catastrophic results. Thus, is it understandable why many feel younger government workers should be incubated before given promotion to important positions.\nHowever, there are several plausible counters to this argument. For one, younger workers bring creativity and fresh ideas to government. For example, young government workers in Canada successfully pushed to increase HIV understanding and dispel stigmas attached to the disease in the 1980s, a development that encouraged tolerance and reduced irrational fear. In addition to fresh ideas, it should be remembered that to get a government job, one has to successfully engage a rigorous screening process. If a younger person engages this process as well or better than an older person, it is hard to argue that age should be a decisive factor when offering employment. It is clear from these reasons that there is merit to awarding important government career options to younger people.\nAlthough the above look reveals solid evidence for both sides of the argument, it is felt that the healthiest approach to designating government positions is to ensure candidates fulfil rigorous training programs. Thus, a person’s age should not be considered a universal precursor to the awarding of government jobs.",

  "text": "Promotional Objective:\n\nOne of the promotional objectives is to increase the awareness of Trivago in Hong Kong. In order to achieve its objectives, Trivago invested more money in the promotion in 2014. For example, it promoted their search engine by the television commercial and Youtube advertisement. The Youtube advertisement means the viewers have to be enforced to watch the advertisement before they watch some video in Youtube. Since most of the people watch the television not just a few minutes or do not just watch one or two video(s) in Youtube, they will be enforced to watch its advertisement more than one times. Trivago has a very simple and rememberable tagline which is ‘Hotels? Trivago’. The audiences are easy to think of Trivago when they are thinking about hotels.\n\nAlso, Trivago wants to increase its market share by entering Hong Kong Market. Many Hong Kongers love to travel and go to different country to feel the culture and enjoy the different lifestyle. Many of them try to plan the cheapest way for their trip include booking the worthiest hotel. If they aware the benefits of using Trivago, they will love to use this as they could spend less time to compare all the hotels. Therefore, Trivago use the advisement to increase its market share in Hong Kong.\n\nMoreover, Trivago is trying to enhance the company image in Hong Kong. Trivago is not much common in Hong Kong. Some people even probably do not know what it is. If Trivago want to gain benefits from the Hong Kong market, it has to develop and enhance their brand image. Doing promotion is one of the ways to improve its image. Trivago is trying to represent that it is the most convenient hotel search engine in the market.\n\nThe last but not the least, Trivago wants to boost its download rate in the mobile application platforms. Almost all the advertisements are encouraging audience to download its mobile application. If there are more people download its mobile application, it means more people to know its brand and use its service.\n\n \nCurrent advertising strategy\n\nWe found one of the Television advertisements which is currently undertaking in Hong Kong.  The advertisement is about 16 seconds. There is a narrator introduces the function of Trivago and demonstrates “how to use its mobile application to search for a worthiest hotel.” At the last of the video, the screen shows a tagline and the website of Trivago. We will analyze its strategies from different perspectives below.\n\nTelevision Commercial\n\nIn general, television is the most popular media in Hong Kong. Advertising by television is an effective way to communicate the service to the general public. Since that television is able to reach a large number of people during a short period of time, more potential customers will be exposed to its service. If the advertisement is designed well, people will remember it.\n\nMoreover, television has the advantage of being able to utilize sight, sound and motion. Combining a catchy theme tune and a well-designed visual advertisement can increase the chances of viewers remembering the brand. This also allows for more creative options. As designers are not limited to using only sound or still images, they can create advertisements that are appealing visually and audibly. \n\nBackground Music\n\nMusic helps stimulates sense and focus attention toward the advertisement. The background music in the advertising is relaxed and excite. It can make people feel youthful and it matches to the taste of young adults which are Trivago’s target customers. Besides, music also has other benefits. It helps audience to better recall the advertisement and stored it in long-term memory. It can also increase the retention of visual information.\n\n\n\nDemonstration\n\nThe television advertisement shows the service being using. It demonstrates all the steps from searching the hotel, choosing selection criteria and comparing the price to different hotels. Through the demonstration, Trivago can show to the audience how easy to use its mobile application to find a worthiest hotel. It can enhance its creditability as the audience can clearly to know what its service is.  \n\nOn the other hand, as a mobile application, some people probably feel confused about how it operates. Therefore, with the visual effect, demonstration is the most effective way to teach the audience to use the mobile application. \n\nInformative\n\nThe television commercial presents information to the audience in a straight-forward manner. The narrator directly indicates the functions of the mobile application. For example, he says the application can instantly compare the rates to over 150 websites. For those who are high interested in hotel searching service, they may notice to such informative advertisement.\n\nCognitive Strategy\n\nIn the television commercial, Trivago uses cognitive message strategy. It clearly presented that its searching engine can help the customers to compare the price of over 150 websites of hotels in the world and find the most worthy hotel. This is a testable claim and Trivago can use it to be its unique selling proposition. This strategy shows its profession and reliability for its target customers. At the same time, it increases the confidence of the customers for choosing its services. \n\nAs Hong Kong is a new market for Trivago, it needs to enhance its popularity in there. Before 2014, Trivago is not famous in Asia. It needs to utilities some strategies to increase its brand awareness and the information about its services toward its customers in order to achieve the promotional objectives.\n\n\nConative Strategy\n\nOn the other hand, Trivago also applies conative strategy in the advertisement. In the television commercial, the narrator tells the audiences to download the Trivago mobile application in their mobile phone. It encourages customer to purchase its services and truly make use of it. The purpose is to increase the sale and enlarge its market share in Hong Kong.\n\nMeans-End Chain\n\nMoreover, “Means-End Chain” is adapted in the television advertisement. The leverage point of Trivago is providing hotel room search services. By using the Trivago’s services, customers can search the worthiest price of the hotel room to gain benefit. \n\nTrivago can achieve the personal value for customers through the advertisement. Some people desire to have a comfortable and pleasure journey with lower prices and the freedom of choosing their favorite accommodation. The advertisement can show that they are wisdom by using Trivogo service to plan an economically trip. \n\nMean-End Chain is being used as Trivago is not only to help customer search for a hotel room, but also to achieve the personal value for customer which is worthier than money the customer saved in booking a hotel room. Trivago use this way to enhance its brand image and competitive advantage since the value of its services is increased.\n\nTagline\n\nNevertheless, Trivago designs a tagline in the television commercial. The tagline ‘‘Hotels? Trivago’’, can introduce the key idea of the television commercial. Audience can easily remember the brand name and get a plain awareness and knowledge of Trivago services. Besides, it can also improve the consistency of advertising platforms. As the tagline is catchy, if the tagline is continuously applied on the other advertisements, it will not be easy to stray from the main idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther communication tools\n\nTrivago does not choose radio to be their media as it is antiquated. People currently seldom listen to the radio. Attention of the radio commercial is low. Also, radio advertisements only contain verbal effect. Without the visual effect, it becomes less attractive. Even through people listen to the radio advertisement of Trivago, they probably do not know how to spell the word ‘Trivago’ as it is not a normal vocabulary. It makes people hard to search Trivago on the Internet. Therefore, the product awareness driven by radio advertisement is not enough. \n\nNewspaper is also not a good media since newspaper has been recently replaced by online newspaper. Likewise, Trivago is an online service so Newspaper advertisement may not appropriate for it. Lastly, hire spokesperson consequent high cost in promotion. And there is a risk of hiring a spokesperson as he may not bring an expected return for the company. Sometimes, if there is a spokesperson in an advertisement, the focus of audience maybe shifts from the product to the spokesperson. The promoting objective is difficult to be achieved. Therefore, television commercial is likely the most suitable method to promote its brand in Hong Kong.\n",

I think I had watched almost all the football matches in history especially when it was the FIFA World Cup season. I would not sleep until the game was over. Although, I don't play really well, but I would choose it over any other sports any day. I enjoy playing football because the feeling you get when you are on the field is priceless. I would feel free when I'm in the field. I was told that I was a natural player when I was young. I didn't need any coaching since my football skills came naturally. I think that I got this from my dad and my elder brother. Both of them are just like me, we freak out when it comes to football! 90% of our conversation includes football and we can talk all day about it for sure. Here is some advice to someone who is starting to this sport. Make sure to play smoothly for the first time and make sure to use a football shoe when you're playing in the field. This advice is to avoid you from injuring yourself as a beginner in football. ",

  "text": "\nDo you have a favourite sport? I've played tennis for 5 years now and I can assure you it's one of the best sports any person can do!\nPlaying tennis means more to me than anything else. First, whether played individually or in teams, it's great fun and demands a lot of effort. Winning or losing is up to you when you play singles, and you know you have to do your best to achieve the best score. Also, I love it because it takes my mind off worries. It has helped me to stay focused and improve my concentration, too. As well as that, tennis gives me the opportunity to stay fit and meet new people.\nSince it's not very easy at the beginning, if you are interested in taking up tennis you should persevere and train at least twice a week. Don't forget to buy a good pair of tennis shoes and a fairly good racket. \nAll in all, I've practised many sports in my life but tennis's been far the best exercise for both, my mind and body. I really get a lot of pleasure in doing it. Give it a try and you'll see! ",

These people believe that ver the next few years we will see a severe decline in the amount of people using bus, trains, trams, etc. to get places. In my opinion, this is dissapointing for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst of all, public transport bring us closer to other people. We share moments with those people using the same mode of transport as us. Also, it is an excellent way of saving the environment. By using public transport we reduce our carbon footprint and help to save the Earth. Furthermore, we also save time: as cities become bigger it becomes more and more difficult to park, which in turn leads to us wasting time looking for somewhere to park, or wasting money in expensive carparks.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that public transport should be a necessary part of everybody's life, we should use it every day to save the Earth, money, and time.",

  "text": "If you’re looking for a great film to watch on a rainy day, I totally recommend Alice in Wonderland. It would give you all the magic of a fantasy film based on a book.\nDirected by Tim Burton, the story is a  retelling of  fantasy novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland .The film shows a young   Alice Troubled by a strange recurring dream, the loss of her beloved father,  an   unwanted marriage proposal, and the oppressive expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of what to does, she chase a rabbit in a blue waistcoat, and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole From which she emerges in a forest, where she is greeted by many strange creatures. There Alice will star an adventure where she must slay the Red evil Queen and restore the White Queen to power.\nThe film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice. With her sweet face, pale skin, and great acting, she looks perfect as a confused and brave girl who has to save that “wonderful” world.  But we must not forget about the marvelous acting of Johnny Deep ( as the mad hatter) and Helena Bonham Carter( as the red queen), with them the film wouldn’t be the same.\nBut it’s not just the acting that is great in this film. The cinematography is fantastic, with wonder digital landscapes. But what really makes it magical is the makeup and the costume design, they really managed to create something amazing  with the appearance of characters. Finally, the film had the great touch of Tim Burton as director.\nIf you enjoy a classic book, but with more action and a little bit twisted; watch Alice in Wonderland.  I totally recommend it, you will not be disappointed.\n",

  "text": "Is science evil? People’s opinions on this question differ widely. I think that science has altered our lives in a positive way. Here are some facts to support my view. \n\n\n\n\nFirstly, I should say that life nowadays is unthinkable without science. In the century of advancing communications and technology it is hard to imagine the world without medicine, astronomy, computers, and history. People today are interested in learning about the surrounding world, about new civilizations and distant planets. Science explains to us a lot of the things that we previously were not aware of. Without its help, for example, we would have never realized were we have come from. It also gives us clues that there may be life on other planets and we might not be the most superior beings in the world. \n\n\n\n\nBy using computers nowadays it is very convenient to find the information you are looking for. \n\n\n\n\nThere is no secret for the human beings today because they have explored every place on the Earth. They climb the highest mountains, dive in the depths of oceans, and conduct dangerous experiments and all for the sake of science. The present belief is that scientific approach will solve all the problems and do away with all difficulties. With its help, for example, people are able to cope with natural disasters. We know how to destroy hail clouds which can cause great damage to our crops. We are also able to protect ourselves from various diseases and help the sick. That is why science is so significant nowadays.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the greatness of science goes together with its disadvantages. For example, we are obliged to agree that science has given no answer to man’s doubts. The obsession to know everything has led some of us to make dangerous experiments for which we pay with our lives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I will only say that science makes our lives easier. With its help we cope with different situations and that is why it is so fundamental to human existence and I think is not evil.\n",

When you start to consider interests and strengths, it makes sense to consider your interests first. After all a successful career is best measured in how satisfying you find it, and it’s easier to develop strengths and skills than to actually have to learn to find something interesting.\nWhile we are studying we may not think seriously about job. But in a few years time our job will be one of the most important things in our everyday life. \nWhen someone asks an adult “what do you do?” they nearly always reply with their occupation. Work, for most of us, will be the defining aspect of life and thus of our identity. Through our work we find an identity, we can find status, intellectual stimulation as well as wealth which enables us to buy comfort. We can work out our place in the world.\nOur working identities can change over time, our identity and behaviours as a young graduate are different from those of the professional expert and from those of the senior leader. Our ability to develop our identity is critical to our ability to be successful in a range of career roles, we need to shed our old identity and add new elements. \nWe each have a picture of who we are and what we will/won’t do in our heads, once formed our brains garner the evidence that it is a true picture and ignore evidence that suggests that it is not true. So people say ‘I don’t do numbers’, ‘I don’t do detail’ ‘I don’t do preparation’, they believe it and make it true. ‘I can’t do sales’ becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. We can change our beliefs, actions and thus our identity through experimentation, practice and conscious self discipline. \nIn an age where career progression may lead us into new environments and sectors it is ever more important to challenge our sense of self and explore whether you can create ‘a new you’ by changing the beliefs you hold about yourself and the world in order to develop and expand your career options.\n",

  "text": "Factors behind the decline \nThere are more than 200 old, abandoned, local buildings in our capital city. But most of them are about to be declined by town planners. This means we will lose a part of our national history. While the fact that those buildings are not seen as worthy of preservation is an important factor, demolition is more frequently caused by a lack of public funds. \n\nFirstly, demolition is partly caused by how valuable the old buildings are estimated. Old local buildings often do not provide opportunities to make any money, they only cost town planners a lot of money because they probably need to be renovated. \n\nHowever, even with these arguments, demolition is more frequently affected by a lack of public funds because it covers the part about the hindsight of an appropriate budget for eventually renovating as well. With no appropriate budget it is unreasonable to keep old buildings which are useless when they are not renovated. And above that, without public funds there are too few people who show they care about the fate of historical buildings. This might cause that town planners will think there are not enough reasons to keep them. \n\nAfter all, the factor with the most influence on decline of local buildings is the lack of public funds which make it possible to keep our old buildings, or at least a few of them, because these funds frequently accumulate money for projects like renovations.",

Not a good scene, is it? Definitely not a good way to start your day. Indeed, the method by which a person go from point A to point B can spell the difference between a good and a bad day. \nTransportation is very important in our daily life and in this modern world we live in, the very least that we expect from almost anything is inconvenience. This is why, most of us, prefer to travel with our own car rather than by  a public transport; not only that it keeps us within our private sphere, it also keeps us dry travelling on a rainy day.

Next year I will be starting the Psychology bachelor programme at the University of Groningen, and I would like to earn some money beforehand. So when I came across this advertisement yesterday, I found myself thinking how wonderful it would be to apply for this job.\n\nI believe myself to be a suitable person for this job, as I am a hard working, reliable, cheerful, fun-loving person. When I was 15 years old, I started looking after our neighbour's children, aged seven and nine. Those children are too old for babysitters now, but I love children and would really like working with them again. I believe myself to be a proficient cook, as I've always cooked for my family in the weekends. When I was almost three years old, my parents moved to Indonesia because of their work circumstances. There I went to Surabaya International School, where I learnt English. Two years later we moved back, but I continued speaking in both Dutch and English to my parents. I also read books in English, so I think my English is certainly good enough for this job.\n\nMy hobbies include drawing, baking cakes, and reading. I like photography too, although I haven't been doing that for a long time. I'm interested in philosophy as well; I enjoy writing essays about psychological or philosophical subjects, so every now and then I write an essay in my free time. \n\nThank you so much for your time, I hope you'll consider me for this position. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nP. Zuidweg",

  "text": "Fame and the attitude to fame have  been  one of the most thought-provoking topics.  Students usually find it very inspiring and engaging to discuss this issue  because it is very difficult to give a clear-cut answer and so, it makes the process of discussion very exciting.  \nThere may be  a significant number of arguments which support the statement that fame is a good thing.   My personal attitude to fame is rather ambivalent. On the one hand, I personally think that the desire to become  famous is a great driving force that stimulates  people and brings a lot of benefits to others in  its wake. Sportsmen are one of the most vivid examples  of it. If  we take football clubs, for  example, we can see that the desire to become well-known and popular makes football players very dedicated sportsmen. They  can fight against the odds to be in the top league. It is remarkable how much stamina and spirit can be  demonstrated by such sportsmen. Their desire to be at the top contributes a lot to the fame and reputation  of their clubs and countries as well.  What is equally important and adds to the importance of fame is that  somebody's  desire to be famous can have a triggering effect on  others. It means that other people feel challenged and don't want to fall  behind and look  underdogs. Without  this  stimulus  they may   have been inactive.   \n\nOn the other hand almost equal number of people may   maintain  a contrasting point of view. They  give examples when the desire to become famous made people aggressive and ruthless. Such people  tried  to achieve their goal irrespective of the means. I can illustrate my words by the example of military campaigns. The desire of some country's leaders to become famous and to glorify their names as great commanders brought about wars and  conflicts between countries. Hundreds and thousands of innocent people may fall victim to the insatiable desire of such fame -seeking personalities.\n\nSo, all in all, we can not answer this  question as \"yes\" or \"no\" because there is almost equal number of examples that help to support the contracting points of view.

I am here today to deliver a speech to you about boycott bullying. These days we see in the walls written boycott of stop bullying. Do we know the real meaning of the word bullying.Bullying may be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally. \n\nBullying is characterized by an individual behaving in a certain way to gain power over another person. It can be classified into four types:\n\nPhysical (hitting, punching, or kicking)\nVerbal (name-calling or taunting)\nRelational (destroying peer acceptance and friendships)\nCyber-bullying (using electronic means to harm others)\n\nThose who have been the targets of bullying can suffer from long term emotional and behavioral problems. Bullying can cause loneliness, depression, anxiety, lead to low self-esteem and illnesses.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that self harm, low self esteem and bullying are all causes of destruction in our schools. We need to stop this. We need to do something to prevent it, before it's too late. Now to boycott bullying form our school i request all of you to take an oath that , I make a commitment to take a stand against bullying. I will treat others with respect and kindness.

She´d cook the best tortilla, paella and all of the typical Spanish dishes  that I´ve ever eaten.\n\nA few years afterwards, right when I started high school and hit my teenager years, I began eating bigger amounts of unhealthy food from American fast food restaurants that I used to go to with my friends some days right  after class and during the weekends. Those years I was very familiar with the smell of cheese burguers, BBQ pizzas  and also kebabs.\n\nBy the time my high school years were done, and right when I attended university, I developed certain predilection for typical healthy Spanish, unavoidibly  combined with less fast food due to the usual diners with friends. The main cause of that change was that I had to have breakfast, lunch and dinner at my college dorm´s dining room that had amazingly good cooks, They´d cook really good dishes such as cocido, garbanzos and paella.

If all of used cars, the levels of pollution would be incredibly high. \u2028Public institutions should encourage the use of public transport, especially trains as they use electricity and are less pollutant than other means of transport.

He would only drag himself out of his house when he heard a new type of food was created. Jack lived with his mommy, he had no job, and when she had told him to be independent, he only lasted one month before going on poverty. He was really sad because the government was enforcing a law on banning new types of food, this had become a huge problem because more Americans were getting diabetes. One day before this new law was established, a crazy scientist created a new waffle, \"the great, furry waffle.\" This was an incentive for Jack to go out, he was sure that destiny had rewarded him with this blessing because he had eaten ten hot dogs in a row, although he felt a bit sick after, he knew it was worth the try. There was a bit of conflict in his plan, the new waffle was in Texas, and he lived in Washington. He knew he wouldn't last a day in the heat, but there was nothing better than a new waffle. He saw on his mommy's television that if he was the first person to try the waffle, he would get a bonus of a hundred bacon strips. Jack bought a ticket to the earliest flight to Texas, once he got off the plane he ran through the landscape. He liked the trend of everyone being fat in America, that way he could fit in. Once he got to the laboratory where the pancake was made, he told the mad scientist that he wanted to eat his waffle. The scientist gave him \"the great, furry waffle\" and a bunch of syrup. Jack grabbed it and put it in his mouth, he could taste heaven in his mouth. It was a combination of bacon, meat, and cheese with a little bit of butter. What he didn't expect was that all the hair had gotten stuck in his throat, leaving him unable to breathe! In a matter of seconds nothing he fell to the ground, choking.

  "text": "Have you ever stopped to think that exist some standards in the society that everyone knows and follows although some people do it unconsciously? These standards are called unwritten rules which can be defined as unspoken rules imposed in each culture to make the population to live more civilly (Bob Greene, How Unwritten Rules Circumscribe Our Lives - Paragraph 6). In fact, since the beginning, the written rules have helped to create the civilizations while the unwritten rules have helped to maintain them, allowing life to be more harmonious. For example I can cite the importance of the unwritten rules in my own culture, the Brazilian culture. There are some aspects and actions that everyone who lives in Brazil needs to follow, and those directly reflect the values of the Brazilian culture.\n\nOne of the most important unwritten rules that you should follow in Brazil is related to the vocal patterns. When Olquin said that the situation and the environment define the correct tone of speech (1995), he was talking about the African American Communication, but he is also describing the Brazilian communication at the same time. Even though there is no definite consensus about the exact vocal patterns in Brazil, there are some facts about the extremes of it. First, Brazilians feel uncomfortable when people close to them raise their tone of voice and continue speaking loudly during a long time, without they have clear reasons. It means that you pretend to transform the dialog in a monolog; moreover, unknown people in the same environment of you frequently do not want to know about your thinking. Surprisingly, on the other hand, a speech too low is seen as an antisocial rule, and can be interpreted as an offense. In Brazilian culture, if during a conversation a person speaks too low, the listener will assume that the speaker does not want to continue with the dialog or does not care about what you are talking. In both the extremes of a speech, loud and low, there is a violation of the values of a good communication. Therefore, when you are in a conversation, it is important to pay attention to execute with successful the unwritten rules of vocal patterns.\n\nAs vocal patterns are considered so important for Brazilians, personal territory is another unwritten rule that is easy to see people using on the streets daily. When you are in a space that you feel comfortable being around other people that you do not know, this space is your personal territory. And, it can change according to your degree of familiarity or intimate with the other person. In some countries like the United States, whose respect of personal territory is extremely important, the public and the intimate space can vary between 25 feet and the touching (Edward T. Hall). In Brazil also there is this difference between the public and the intimate space, yet the magnitude of this is not the same of the U.S. Although the Brazilians have a shorter personal space in comparison with the United States, they are no tolerant with strangers invading it. Soon, even though the distance between people are shorter in Brazil, both countries value the idea of maintaining a space that both people feel comfortable, called personal space.\n\nAlthough Brazilians usually do not worry about distance made by others, people from different cultures believe that Brazilians spend much time looking at others. As a result, some people can make misinterpretations. For example, in some cultures, Brazilians can be considered rude by women because they like to keep a constant eye contact, and for these women this means a lack of respect or invasion of privacy. Differently, foreign men often believe that they are being desired due to this constant eye contact. In general, this supposition is not regarded as true for many people in our culture since Brazilians believe that constant eye contact is one of the most important points to maintain a good dialog. According to article \" Nonverbal Communication: Speaking without Words\", eye contact is important because \"insufficient eye contact can create communication barriers\". In fact, in Brazil, the eye contact is primordial, being considered without interest to speaker or that the speaker is bothering you if you do not give enough attention when you are talking to. The source of this rule is easy to be identified especially when the parents are talking to their kids; it is hard to get exclusively the kid's attention, but the parents insistently repeat, \"look at me when I am talking to you\". Therefore, this interaction demonstrates that the eye contact can have a strong influence in the cultural values of attentiveness and respect with the others' opinion.\n\nAfter being socially judged by the society, we can perceive the direct influence of unwritten rules in our cultural values when someone breaks at least one of them. In Brazil, the social rules like vocal patterns reflect in the communication values which can be decisive to keep a good communication. Also, the personal territory are governed by rules that vary depending on the country, and in Brazil are considered small, but everyone there appreciates this cultural value. Eye contact is another important cultural value which is used by Brazilians meaning respect and interest for others. As in Brazil, each country around the world has reflections of the unwritten rules in the cultural values. Because of these varieties of values and rules, usually there are some misunderstandings between people of different nations. Respecting these rules is the first step to understand them and avoid some conflicts. In addition, you should avoid judge cultural values from other countries based on unwritten rules of your own.",

  "text": "According to Ferguson et all (2013), dietary nitrate (NO3-) supplementation, via its reduction to nitrite (NO2-) and subsequent conversion to nitric oxide (NO), reduces blood pressure. Bond, Morton and Braakhuis (2012) also argue that nitrate is considered a potent vasodilator. The reason for this is that the nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels and dilates them, which helps the blood flow more easily and lowers blood pressure. Thus, the induced vasodilation may affect both systolic and diastolic  blood pressure after the exercise. Nevertheless, a study of The New England Journal of Medicine claims that only the diastolic blood pressure is affected by nitrate supplement, once it was not found in their study a significant change on systolic blood pressure after nitrate supplementation in healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, the current study has found significant changes in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure post exercise. Thus, the investment on research about the influence of nitrate supplementation should continue, the aim of which would be to improve sports performance and improved quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that supplementation of beetroot juice has no significant effect on 700 m rowing ergometer performance. It is unquestionable that some research found  significant improvements. In this present study, however, the rowing time of the participants was not shorter than times without supplementation. Importantly, it was not found serious changes in blood lactate levels either. It was assumed that beetroot juice would increase the oxidation and would reduce the lactate production. Nevertheless, the nitrate supplementation did not change the lactate level significantly. Finally, it was confirmed that nitric oxide relaxes blood vessels, consequently reducing the blood pressure. By this action, beetroot juice may effectively protect the cardiovascular system during exercising. Despite the present findings, it is necessary more research to understand the effects of nitrate supplementation. By this action, athletes may improve their performance as well as quality of life.",

  "text": " Dear editor,\n    I read your article about technology and education in the newspaper yesterday and I am writing this letter because I strongly disagree with your personal opinion about teachers and education. Due to the fact that I am studying to become a teacher, I have some more knowledge about this subject than any other people because I am in the school classroom every day and I face the reality of it every day. \n    To begin with, I agree with you that technology sometimes makes the educational process easier and more pleasant in this way that students have no idea that they broaden their knowledge. Of course, I make use of computer and projector during my teaching daily, because this is a pleasant and entertaining activity for children. After all, my objection is that interactive learning is not the only way for children to be educated. The traditional educational process may sometimes seem to be boring and dull for children but a teacher should be a part of this process as a guide. Without teachers’ guidance, self- studying may bring some problems to children, such as possible misunderstanding.  Networking educational contents are not safe at all. It is common for children to watch violence scenes. So, the teacher is a necessary part of the educational process.\n    Nowadays, young people graduate from universities, who come up with new and innovative ideas about educational process and so the tradition will be updated next years. To be more precise, new educational methods promotes the students’ teamwork. In other words, students have the opportunity to discuss with their classmates in order to solve a mathematic problem in cooperation or to talk about a subject. Furthermore, when it’s necessary good students can help the other classmates to improve themselves.  In this kind of education, teacher is only the guide who helps students to discover the information on their own. Furthermore, it makes children more sociable. In contrast, interactive learning may bring some advantages but it can also makes children antisocial, because they learn on their own without the need to be in the school with other people. They don’t need to co-operate and to work as a team. This is bad, because it will be necessary to work as team in their future job and then they will face serious communicative problems.\n     To sum up, I am not against interactive learning and the use of technology. My personal opinion is this is not sufficient to cover the education process.  I think that it is efficient when there is a combination of traditional education and interactive learning.\n",

This is a good option especially during the summer time. While doing these activities, teenagers will easily make new friends and develop new skills. Also this is a healthy way of getting fit.\nThis sports centre provides a huge variety of physical activities. One of these is athleticism. “Campo de Marte” is one of the few places in Lima where you can practise athleticism professionally. Besides, you have the chance to take part in international competitions if you stand out. Another important activity is swimming. You can practise it in a semi- Olympic swimming pool, which is always clean and protected against the sunlight. However, during the winter it can be not warm enough to swim properly.\nI strongly recommend young people to choose sports in which you can take part of a team. This experience would teach you how to work with different kind of people.\n",

  "text": "Dear Mr Michael Wallis,\n\nThank you so much for this opportunity, I am very grateful for everything.  I think English is in fact very important because first of all although not being the most spoken language in the world, it is the official language in a large number of countries.  Most of the content produced on the internet (50%) is in English and last but not least although learning English can be challenging and steals some of our precious time, we can see that it is also very valuable to learn and can also create many opportunities.\n\nAbout the accommodation, we talked and decided that we would prefer to be with English speaking families because of what a great opportunity it is for everyone to actually test their speaking skills. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am certain that we will cherish every second of every minute there.\n\nI was actually about to email you about the activities that are to be planned. Regarding the students preferences, they all love the outdoors, like parks and rivers and they also love a good museum because of their thirst for knowledge. All in all, anything that will keep them away from being bored and with nothing to do.\n\nConcerning this amazing trip I only have two questions left starting with the weather, considering your experience with the changes happening this time of the year and the second and last about what type of clothes you recommended which is of great importance primarily for our female students .\n\nYours sincerely\nMargaret Dunn",

  "text": "I agree with the statement above to some extent. On the positive side, travelling by car is more relaxed because you do not have to rely on others to drive for you. Actually you have more freedom in which roads to choose and you can have breaks whenever you feel a need for some time off the street. In addition, driving by yourself you are not limited by the stations you have to visit. Going by train for example, you need to get to the next train station and afterwards from the destination train station to your target. Often enough you have to rely on other services such as busses or taxis to reach your destination. \nOn the other hand, using public transportation is good for the environment because the amount of gas, electricity and other materials is a lot lower per head. Furthermore you have the chance to take a nap, do some work or watch TV while you are being transported. Moreover you can be lucky to avoid big traffic jams especially if you are taking the train. Avoiding traffic jams, construction sites, accidents and other obstacles you may being affected by may result in a lower amount of time spent travelling.\nAs a conclusion you can say public transport will have its use even in the future. While going by car may be more comfortable from time to time, the reasons I stated above lead me to the conclusion that public transport is necessary.",

Public transportation modes like trains and buses have been immensely helpful to the general public throughout the past couple of decades. On the other hand, travelling by car is getting for popular than it ever was with development of science and technology.\n\nPeople who are based on rural and remote areas are always prefer to use public transportation according to the researchers from Columbia University. However,in some countries, public transportation is a nightmare because it has not been maintained by the governments properly, this is one of the main reasons which had led people to use personal vehicles rather than relying on public transportation.\n\nNot only people in countries where it has poor public transportation but also the most developed countries, there is a high tendency of using cars instead of depending on public transportation. Despite the fact that using cars being expensive, many people still prefer to use their own vehicles because it saves their valuable time. Public transportation, on the other hand, consumes a lot of time to travel from one distance to another.                           ",

But what exactly makes spy stories so fascinating? There could be a lot of reasons, like the idea of living in an adventurous way or doing things in secret; but in real life, what kind of person does a secret agent have to be?\n\nFirst of all, being a spy requires special skills; not everybody is suitable for this kind of life. For instance, the ability to bear both physical and psychological stress is not something you can easily learn. In the same way a secret agent has to be able to take risks when required. Therefore bravery is very important: nobody needs a fearful spy. A secret agent works undercover, so his most important quality is possessing great skill in lying. Besides, since his work is secret, he can't let anybody, including family and friends, know about it.\n\nSo, although the life of secret agents may seem fascinating and exciting, it is also difficult and risky and not so simple as the one shown in films.",
