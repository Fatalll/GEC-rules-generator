It was really importatnt for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he haven't got any achievements. He was very happy and he decided to celebrate. He invited all his friends from team and made a party. Tom wanted Mel, his girlfriend, to come too. She was really proud of him. She was dreaming about being his wife. She wanted to be his wife so bad. But he didn't love her enough. He wanted to break up with her at that party. He was waiting 2 hours for her. He hated that she is always late. That was the main reason he wanted to end it up. When Mel came she looked gorgeous. And when he saw her, his heart started to beating faster and faster. But time's up. He got closer to her and told her everything. Mel looked sadly at Tom, then said: \"I'm pregnant...\" and got out of his home. He followed and apoligized her. He said he was drunk and didn't know what he was saying. Then he hugged her. He said he loved her and kissed her forehead. He had to stay with her because of... the baby. He couldn't just leave her carrying his baby! No! He has never acted like this. He knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby. He decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel. One day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital. He felt that something bad was going to happen. And he was right. Mel has lost the baby. Tom had to make a hard decision. His life was going to change. Mel was crying all day and Tom couldn't stand it. He has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad.

These activities are the most popular and the most expensive too. However, I fully recommend them, especially for sporty, adventurous and young people.\n\n·Others ideas to have fun\nIn Castelldefels, there are other activities less popular, but cheaper, for instance: free zumba masterclass, yoga beach, running... as sports activities, and as social activities there are library group, theatre... As I said, these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Canal and the beach, but their success is increasing more and more.\n\n·Recommendation\nSo, finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types  of activities, both popular and the newest. If you tried all the activities, you would spend a great time here, in Castelldefels!",

Today globalization is bringing the world more close, that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures, for example in literature, poetry, films, TV programs, music or some other aspect of the culture.\nOn balance, learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect, so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it, because it will bring you many benefits. \n\n",

The colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised. After that, it comes to the most significant stage, that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets. People usually divided the quality into three parts: Good quality, Partially damaged, and bad sheets.\n\nAs for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good, people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes. If the partially damaged sheets are bad, they will be treated as bad sheets, which will be securely distoryed.\n\nIn conclusion, the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes. Eventhough it seems to be easy to make them, but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone.",

We also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology, and hosting management.  However it’s possible that we don’t find enough people with that profile so, we could accept people with one year of experience.\n\nIs it possible to do the meeting this week? When and where do you prefer? (Remember that I work from 8 a.m to 6 p.m) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office, so you don’t have to move to another place.\n\nFinally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have, and please tell me if you find another different request than I tell you before in that e-mail.\n\nPlease, answer me with the information as soon as possible.\n\nÍñigo Ojeda.\n\n\n",

Because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I  have their authographs on the newest record. I didn't have many duties and none of them were unpleasant. In general I had only one duty that is checking quest list, above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert. But that concert was worth of my work, so I hope I will be invited to their next event. Working for them was a real pleasure.

In addition, I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the next course it will take place next year.\nFirst, I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class. They were not only really clever people but also excellent co-workers. Working collaboratively is, in fact, the most interesting way of learning any subject even English.\nSecond, the teachers were really good skills to teach. They managed to encourage all of us every day. This way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level.\nThird, phonetic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy. They helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course.\nHowever, in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher’s team. This way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising.\nTo wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year.\nYours sincerely,\nJuan Orozco\n",

My father works as a teacher and so does my mother. I have one brother and one sister. I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes. My hobbies are travelling, reading stories and writing my thoughts.\n\n I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization (WHO). It isn't just a dream in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true. Last two years, I worked in many places such as a pharmacy, a restaurant and the water purification company.\n\n I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study, I want to know more and more. In my childhood, my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine, I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality. When I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people. One of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drug for one the incurable like cancer, AIDS and hepatitis.\n\n I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life? And what are the benefits of work and study? But if you see your world and realize it well, it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes. I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better.\n\n I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also, I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn.\n",

  "text": "Is there a future for Privately owned cars? To be honest, I am not sure.\nAlthough privately oned cars are more and more popular, and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries, it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future.\nMost people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution. Carbon based fuels will not last forever. I would say that most probably private care are not \"sustainables\" in the long term, and it will be necessary to revert to some sort of public transport. \nThe population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a staggering 3 billions human beings. I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around, each of them with its own private small helicopter. But it is not going to happen. I guess that in our future there are no helicopters, and not even cars. \nStates and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative. T\nhe price for independent transport will grow dramatically. I reckon that that will change the habits of the public.\nEven though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time, the nice old train could become important again.\n",

  "text": "  Imagine this picture: the first class of this semester, students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher; while the teacher ask for the answer, students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester. Students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation, students will not remember the knowledge they have learned, partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study, and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying. Therefore, I agree with the statement that students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying. More reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs.\n  To begin with, there is a general consensus, students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time. For example, on history class, history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester. It is very wasting time and not efficient.\n  Next to go would be, students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation. For example, when the semester start, students cannot get away from the sunshine, beach, and travelling. In the class, students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher.\n  Last but not least, some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time. For instance, learning English should be a daily education, if you have a long time without learning English, you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar.\n  In a nutshell, based on aforementioned, I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better, more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying.",

I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems. I like to speak with my team partners. Together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match. when I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support. that is priceless.

  "text": "Most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they  used to live , so, they need an accommodation to live through their study years . Most universities provide cheap accommodations such as, shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs, where most students have low income. Other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently \nSharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as, cheap, safe, close to the university, and learn how to share everything with others.  saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring  an apartment, and because it will be closer to the university , saving  money and time is  more efficient by reducing transportation`s  costs\nIn spite all these benefits, I prefer- if I can - to live in  an apartment where the personality is very important for me . Many years ago, I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life, he was dirty, speaking loudly all time and  did not share the budget of eating. living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends. this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms.\nthey annoying me\n\nAlthough The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government . The powerful of the federalism which  has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states. An example of that is the marriage of homosexual  where some state admit this marriage, others don't  .\n Also, the reading passage declares  that even the federal government  let each state function independently, it still control on the main decisions . this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert . also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states\nIn conclusion, federal government which give freedom and powerful, cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .\n",

  "text": "Travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time.  \nI think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments. In order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor. \nPeople say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip: arrived, get away to the frustration of an unknown place, get alone with your trip companion, success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal. In order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion. This minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city. As an example, if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip, exchange some pictures, eat together, and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls. \nOther advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food. Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country.  For example, there are a lot of American people that doesn´t like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food. As  advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper. In this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country. \nIn conclusion, I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country: Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious!\n",

  "text": "After the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969, Social Media Site (SMS) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication. SMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages, and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds. Unsurprisingly, social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication, regardless of distance or time. However, people who use Facebook, Twitter or SMS in general, are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying. This essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter, and also comments potential future of these implications.\n\nCommunicating can be achieved, regardless of distance, through Facebook and Twitter. The benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers. Firstly, Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood, and in where their negative feelings are expressed. Secondly, Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends, making observations of relationships, maintaining one’s own feeling within the network (through wall posts, pokes, messages, etc) (Oldmeadow, Quinn, & Kowert, 2013). That is to say, human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood, and receiving responses. Thirdly, Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business. Knowledge about the members increases continually, and moreover, maintaining relations with other existing members, and also sharing their same interests by the social network. (Emerald Group Publishing, 2013). Finally, people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter. For instance, by following famous celebrities, people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them. However, due to this, people who are being followed, or users in general, may have less personal privacy, and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone.\n\nHowever, information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible, therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion. However, information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible, therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion. Mostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing. In fact, along with agreeable and pleasant comments, there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment. First of all, people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person. For example, after the premier of The Hunger Game was released, a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person (Rauch and Schanz, 2013). Because of the accessible information through SMS, it has led to many problems involve with cycle-bullying, cycle-badgering, cycle-stalking behaviour (Krishna, as cited in Williams & Merten, 2008). For example, Krishna et al.(2013) reports a case of  continuous disturbing a woman from a man called  Mr.X “admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment, trespassing and telephone harassment” (pp. 576.e1-576.e2).\n\n Potentially, Facebook and Twitter, and SMS in general, may replace face to face communication and improve their functions, because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances. Therefore, it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second, rather than have to call them. The possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS, the less communicate skills that they have. In addition, to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts, Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem. For example, controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options. However, despite the useful of these implications, people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently. Also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel.

Also, this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life, because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays, travels, special ocassions, etc. \n\nAs a new college subject\n\nThis practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation. However, teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw. Both skills are required in today's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level.\n\nThe reasons\n\nRecent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world, especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids). This increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers, cameras, cellphones, etc. Also, photography is considered as a type of art, so it requires the knowledge of especial skills, techniques and knowledge.\n\n\n",

The government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume. If people don't use public transportation, they could walk, ride a bike or buy a traditional car, and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live.\n\n\nFrom my point of view, public transportation will be very important in the future, especially in developed countries.

All historians, researchers, scientists agree with this. And as for me, I totally support their point of view. Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara. All over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians.  Furthermore, elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands. The Egyptians called their country `Black Land` to mark it off of the red soil of desert. Nowadays, deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt. Through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile. The ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to dry or wet period. They knew when it will be the `Green Nile` or `Red Nile` to stock up with clean water. But such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive. The great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals. Anyway, a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink.

In this  living situation, instead of laughter and happiness, there will be more fight, hatred and sadness. Everyone lives in despair, but cannot find the entrance to brightness.

On the one hand, holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life. People can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful. For instance, in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future. Besides, people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces. The reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love, helping people or thinking spiritual things. It can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings. For example, people meet their relatives that never see for a long time. At the same time, people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls. They can pray for God and it gives a relief for people. When people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy. Because people need to leave the material world. In holidays, people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life.

Firstly, it reduces traffic jams, noise and pollution, as well as it lowers CO2 emissions. Furthermore, it turns out to be the quickest method of transport. \n\nOn the other hand, there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads.

  "text": "No one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport. For example, people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway. And this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays, due to less frequent schedule. Also, we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach. When the bus is crowded, we have to stand, making us more exhausting especially for a long distance. Even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above, advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected.\n\nFirst, public transport is good for the environment compared to private car. As we all know, the more  public transport passengers use, the less car exhausts are emitted per person. Recently, several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers. In other words, public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life.\n\nSecond, public transport saves city spaces. As more and more people choose to live in cities, nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded. Correspondingly, the space for each person becomes more limited than before. Provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance, I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting.\n\nLast but not the least, public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving. The drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings, resulting in a tense spirit. For a passenger, however, travelling is a complete relax. People can listen to music, take a phone call with a friend, read a fascinating book or just loot at outside. \n\nThough there are many advantages for public transport, it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation. E.g., it offers less flexibility than cars, and is less environment friendly than bicycles.  Therefore, it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others. It is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one.",

  "text": "  Today, I went to my Winnie's home with Adriana in the afternoon. We ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether. We had a great time.\n  At 2 o'clock in he afternoon, we arrived at Winnie's home. First, we listened to some songs, such as almost and big big world. After thirty minutes, we had tea. Winnie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home. We had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy. After having tea, we play hide-and-seek altogether in Winnie's garden.Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us. Suddenly, Winnie fell over a little stone. Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up. 'Your knee is bleeding. Are you okay'I asked.I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was worried about Winnie. I had butterflies in my stomach.'Yes, I am fine,' Winnie replied.I felt relieved then. Then, Adriana found a plaster and put it on Winnie's wound.Winnie felt warm inside and smiled happily.\n  I felt glad today although Winnie hurt herself. Why? It is because our friendship is more rugged. What an unfoggetable day!",

  "text": "Swimming is my favourite sport. Why do I like swimming? Well, swimming has always been an Olympic sport, it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer's efforts, but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions. It is a sport that requires a lot of fitness, it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age. Swimming has different types; dolphin , crawl, backstroke and breast stroke.\nSwimming as a sport is very useful in wieght reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your wieght, it is also the best sport for the asthmatic patients because it strengthens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections.\nIf you will start to learn swimming, choose a place that has an experienced coach, and try to be part of a group of your age.  \n",

  "text": "\nHello Paul,\nI enjoyed helping at the concert which was in Antaya on October. I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert. I got a lot of  experience from them. In the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert. I saw so many interesting things during the preparetion time. For example they know everything about each helper’s jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects. I want explain to you some interesting part from my experience. In the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given. When we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us. Some of them started design the stage, some of them checking songs volume and lights. My job was checking songs list which singers would perform. I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers. They were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list. On the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly. Actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it. Finally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars. It is difficult to explain that feeling. When the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely. Of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing. However, I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects. I want to invite you  to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert. I am waiting for  your email. \nSee you!\n",

  "text": "Public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives. More than a billion  people use buses , taxi's and trains etc as tourists ,for work , meeting relatives,going to school etc.Many even use cars. Though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive. That is why because the cost of petrol, diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world. While travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways:\n1. People can save the money they spend on petrol.\n2. As they have specific routes across the country ,town ,city and villages, it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc.\nI disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society, the rich and the poor. Middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day. It is because of high taxes on goods. So, I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age. Public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars.\n",

  "text": "Nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies. Some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions.\nI agree with this point of view. I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book. Firstly, reading helps to become a well Educated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge. That's why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information. Furthermore, books develops imagination of reader. When you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind. You can imagine how heroes look Like,you can imagine different views, where the action takes place. And finally, I think it's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want. \nOn the other hand,if you like being in company the best way for you is movies. Because you can watch it with your friends. Also many people choose movies because they like soundtracks and special effects. It's so exciting.\nbut all these factors are not important for me. I suppose that books are better than them film version.\nTo sum up, I'd like to say reading is really great thing.",

Talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing. Besides, it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly. However, you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks.\n\nFrom my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it. But if you do not, there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need. You can even talk with native speakers by using some Chat Rooms online such as Skipe and others.\n\n\n\n\n",

However, people should think about the large advantages, such as: people save money; it is very comfortable and good for the environment.\n\nFirstly, the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive. The cars need to be repaired; besides, if you have a car, you have to pay some taxes. In addition, these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city.\n\nSecondly, another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted. If you use the public transport, you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport.\n\nFinally, the last reason is the comfort because you have a car; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city. Besides in some cities, car cannot be parked in some places, such as: the old city and the city centre.\n\nSumming up, people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car.

However, the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one.\nLast 50 years science and technology took great leaps, internet, mobiles made us more connected. Today, we have all the information at finger-tips. Today, we don't need to worry about getting lost at new place, Google maps are always there to help. We need not to cram English words today, as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles.

Today our lives have become much more comfortable than past, thanks to progress mankind has made in technology.\nOn the other hand a number of terrorism, global warming and greed became top challenges of today's world. Climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then. Terrorist activities causing havoc in public live. Corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders. If these challenges are not addressed in coming years, imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult.

Also it makes us more clever. I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good.

They believe that it is useless thing for our generation. Such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid. They insist on not using tablets at school.\nPersonally for me, I like books very much .when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books.

As a result, our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it.\nThe local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports. That's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas.\nFinally,the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need. In fact, around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the  yellow, green and blue containers in every street. And that is the negative point, these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones.\n",

I didn’t knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone, now I have to find my parents.

We made some incentives about laws, but it was a total conflict, because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow. I think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping. So everybody is gonna try to enforce the laws. In the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us. In the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises.  I stalked him and it seemed that this guy has a hump. I stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group. We were talking about this when a dog just came near; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature. He bit my leg and it hurt a lot, we tried to alert the others but it was too late, it was the group or us. We saw that beast eating our friends and the food. In some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival. But if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this.",

  "text": "Is there any future to public transport, for travelling by car is much more convenient ? Many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing, though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling. This composition will explain the two different opinions. \n\nFirstly, the car is more convenient because there is privacy. Also, unlike public transport such as buses and underground, you have much more comfort and speed. There is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice.\nOn the website of The Scottish Government (publication \"Young people and transport\"), a 12-14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car, it's quicker...There's not as many people around you... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well. »\nAlthough they are many positive points about private cars, they are also negative ones. Indeed, cars increases the pollution, you have traffic congestion, and it is very expensive. « - On my wage, even the driving lessons are expensive. Then just owning a car and looking after your car, insurance, tax, etc. Obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh, but I don't work in Edinburgh.» says a 17-22 years old boy. \n\nNow, secondly, travelling by public transport is cheaper (we don't pay any fees on public transport, but also, it is safer, According to The Saigon Times, there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars. The main reason is that the cars' owners are drunk when driving. It is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank,it would not have as much accidents.\n\nFinally, many developed countries on the world,such as England, America, Canada, Japan and so on, have built a public transport system, so the traffic jam have been decreased. As a result, the economy has been increasing. From this analysis, it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important.\n",

  "text": "Topic:\nDo you agree or disagree \"Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship\" ?\n\nDisagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion. Even though being truthful is crucial in relationship, always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others' feelings and is unwise. Another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer. It is better to tell a little white lie at this moment.\nTo further illustrate the first point above, could hurt one's feelings by telling the truth at all time. For example, if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion. People usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings. Instead of doing so, people may praise her with other things on her. In that case, they could still make conversions without boiling her mood.\nThe other point is when it comes to personal matters, people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted. If there are questions about things one do not want other people to know, they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much. If I was having a day off to go to a doctor, I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run.These are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not.",

In my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time.\n\nAs far as I’m concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation. Unfortunately, this is a part of celeb's 'work' so they have to take into account. But on the other hand, there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time. This rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal, not famous people. I know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids. To my mind, they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts\n\nSo, as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people,who are recognizable, deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them.\n",

  "text": "The Maze Runner\n\nI recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author. As I have an interest in thrillers, I decided to give it a try. The poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film.\n\nThe film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character, which is a 16-year-old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp. He has no idea how he ended up there.However, he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp, which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze. The people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze. He took the role of a runner, the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place. Still, they only have the daylight time to explore the maze, as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous.\n\nThe film keeps getting better and better as you watch it, having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze. I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent.",

Personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything, but when I don't, it still keeps me wanting more. I am always trying to jump higher, hit harder, pass and set better, and serve in more different ways. ",

The surroundings were rustic, yet it still felt airy and cosy, the waiters were very friendly and informative. As I was eaten with my friend Moreno and his father, I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chianina beef, it was very tasty. All the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality. \nThe price wasn't reasonable at all, because the meal came to about forty euros per person, so this restaurant it's a little expensive.\nBut I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners.

  "text": "Drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy. They have been present in our societies since ever. Cannabis, heroin, speed are some examples of substances that are really well-known for all of us.\nLegalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion. Margination has a link with the illegality of this activity. \nAlso this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating. The real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives. I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun, enjoy friends or just to prove them, and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things. But we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves.\nFinally, legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not.",

In that time, it is always sunny and, depending on the region, it could rain.\nIf you want to see some beautiful scenery, you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia, which was built by Antoni Gaudi, or La Alambra in Granada, which is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. In Madrid you can go to visit some museums, like the Reina Sofía or El Prado.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to see some wildlife, you must visit Cabarcenos National Park in Cantabria, what is like a little safari, or Doñana National Park, which in that period you can see some migration birds.\n\nIf I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain, I would stay one week in each place, and I rent a car in order to move between the cities.
